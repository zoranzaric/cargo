<p>The easiest way to get Cargo is to get the current stable release of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> by
using the <code>rustup</code> script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ curl -sSf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh
</code></pre>
<p>After this, you can use the <code>rustup</code> command to also install <code>beta</code> or <code>nightly</code>
channels for Rust and Cargo.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#install-nightly-cargo" id="install-nightly-cargo"><h3>Install Nightly Cargo</h3></a>
<p>To install just Cargo, the current recommended installation method is through
the official nightly builds. Note that Cargo will also require that <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is
already installed on the system.</p>

<p>To start a new project with Cargo, use <code>cargo new</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo new hello_world --bin
</code></pre>
<p>We’re passing <code>--bin</code> because we’re making a binary program: if we
were making a library, we’d leave it off.</p>
<p>Let’s check out what Cargo has generated for us:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cd hello_world
$ tree .
.
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs

1 directory, 2 files
</code></pre>
<p>This is all we need to get started. First, let’s check out <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;Your Name &lt;you@example.com&gt;&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>This is called a <strong>manifest</strong>, and it contains all of the metadata that Cargo
needs to compile your project.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s in <code>src/main.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Cargo generated a “hello world” for us. Let’s compile it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/project/hello_world)
</code></pre>
<p>And then run it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ ./target/debug/hello_world
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>We can also use <code>cargo run</code> to compile and then run it, all in one step:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo run

<a class="header" href="print.html#why-cargo-exists" id="why-cargo-exists"><h2>Why Cargo Exists</h2></a>
<p>Cargo is a tool that allows Rust projects to declare their various
dependencies and ensure that you’ll always get a repeatable build.</p>
<p>To accomplish this goal, Cargo does four things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduces two metadata files with various bits of project information.</li>
<li>Fetches and builds your project’s dependencies.</li>
<li>Invokes <code>rustc</code> or another build tool with the correct parameters to build
your project.</li>
<li>Introduces conventions to make working with Rust projects easier.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-new-project" id="creating-a-new-project"><h2>Creating a New Project</h2></a>
<p>To start a new project with Cargo, use <code>cargo new</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo new hello_world --bin
</code></pre>
<p>We’re passing <code>--bin</code> because we’re making a binary program: if we
were making a library, we’d leave it off. This also initializes a new <code>git</code>
repository by default. If you don't want it to do that, pass <code>--vcs none</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s check out what Cargo has generated for us:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cd hello_world
$ tree .
.
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs

1 directory, 2 files
</code></pre>
<p>If we had just used <code>cargo new hello_world</code> without the <code>--bin</code> flag, then
we would have a <code>lib.rs</code> instead of a <code>main.rs</code>. For now, however, this is all
we need to get started. First, let’s check out <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;Your Name &lt;you@example.com&gt;&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>This is called a <strong>manifest</strong>, and it contains all of the metadata that Cargo
needs to compile your project.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s in <code>src/main.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Cargo generated a “hello world” for us. Let’s compile it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/project/hello_world)
</code></pre>
<p>And then run it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ ./target/debug/hello_world
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>We can also use <code>cargo run</code> to compile and then run it, all in one step (You
won't see the <code>Compiling</code> line if you have not made any changes since you last
compiled):</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo run
   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/project/hello_world)
     Running `target/debug/hello_world`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll now notice a new file, <code>Cargo.lock</code>. It contains information about our
dependencies. Since we don’t have any yet, it’s not very interesting.</p>
<p>Once you’re ready for release, you can use <code>cargo build --release</code> to compile
your files with optimizations turned on:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo build --release
   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/project/hello_world)
</code></pre>
<p><code>cargo build --release</code> puts the resulting binary in <code>target/release</code> instead of
<code>target/debug</code>.</p>
<p>Compiling in debug mode is the default for development-- compilation time is
shorter since the compiler doesn't do optimizations, but the code will run
slower. Release mode takes longer to compile, but the code will run faster.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#working-on-an-existing-cargo-project" id="working-on-an-existing-cargo-project"><h2>Working on an Existing Cargo Project</h2></a>
<p>If you download an existing project that uses Cargo, it’s really easy
to get going.</p>
<p>First, get the project from somewhere. In this example, we’ll use <code>rand</code>
cloned from its repository on GitHub:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git
$ cd rand
</code></pre>
<p>To build, use <code>cargo build</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo build
   Compiling rand v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/project/rand)
</code></pre>
<p>This will fetch all of the dependencies and then build them, along with the
project.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dependencies" id="dependencies"><h2>Dependencies</h2></a>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> is the Rust community's central package registry that serves as a
location to discover and download packages. <code>cargo</code> is configured to use it by
default to find requested packages.</p>
<p>To depend on a library hosted on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, add it to your <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#adding-a-dependency" id="adding-a-dependency"><h3>Adding a dependency</h3></a>
<p>If your <code>Cargo.toml</code> doesn't already have a <code>[dependencies]</code> section, add that,
then list the crate name and version that you would like to use. This example
adds a dependency of the <code>time</code> crate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
time = &quot;0.1.12&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The version string is a <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik/semver#requirements">semver</a> version requirement. The <a href="reference/specifying-dependencies.html">specifying
dependencies</a> docs have more information about
the options you have here.</p>
<p>If we also wanted to add a dependency on the <code>regex</code> crate, we would not need
to add <code>[dependencies]</code> for each crate listed. Here's what your whole
<code>Cargo.toml</code> file would look like with dependencies on the <code>time</code> and <code>regex</code>
crates:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;Your Name &lt;you@example.com&gt;&quot;]

[dependencies]
time = &quot;0.1.12&quot;
regex = &quot;0.1.41&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Re-run <code>cargo build</code>, and Cargo will fetch the new dependencies and all of
their dependencies, compile them all, and update the <code>Cargo.lock</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo build
      Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
   Downloading memchr v0.1.5
   Downloading libc v0.1.10
   Downloading regex-syntax v0.2.1
   Downloading memchr v0.1.5
   Downloading aho-corasick v0.3.0
   Downloading regex v0.1.41
     Compiling memchr v0.1.5
     Compiling libc v0.1.10
     Compiling regex-syntax v0.2.1
     Compiling memchr v0.1.5
     Compiling aho-corasick v0.3.0
     Compiling regex v0.1.41
     Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/project/hello_world)
</code></pre>
<p>Our <code>Cargo.lock</code> contains the exact information about which revision of all of
these dependencies we used.</p>
<p>Now, if <code>regex</code> gets updated, we will still build with the same revision until
we choose to <code>cargo update</code>.</p>
<p>You can now use the <code>regex</code> library using <code>extern crate</code> in <code>main.rs</code>.</p>
<pre><code>extern crate regex;

use regex::Regex;

fn main() {
    let re = Regex::new(r&quot;^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$&quot;).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;Did our date match? {}&quot;, re.is_match(&quot;2014-01-01&quot;));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Running it will show:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo run
   Running `target/hello_world`
Did our date match? true
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#project-layout" id="project-layout"><h2>Project Layout</h2></a>

<a class="header" href="print.html#cargotoml-vs-cargolock" id="cargotoml-vs-cargolock"><h2>Cargo.toml vs Cargo.lock</h2></a>
<p><code>Cargo.toml</code> and <code>Cargo.lock</code> serve two different purposes. Before we talk
about them, here’s a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Cargo.toml</code> is about describing your dependencies in a broad sense, and is
written by you.</li>
<li><code>Cargo.lock</code> contains exact information about your dependencies. It is
maintained by Cargo and should not be manually edited.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re building a library that other projects will depend on, put
<code>Cargo.lock</code> in your <code>.gitignore</code>. If you’re building an executable like a
command-line tool or an application, check <code>Cargo.lock</code> into <code>git</code>. If you're
curious about why that is, see <a href="faq.html#why-do-binaries-have-cargolock-in-version-control-but-not-libraries">&quot;Why do binaries have <code>Cargo.lock</code> in version
control, but not libraries?&quot; in the
FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dig in a little bit more.</p>
<p><code>Cargo.toml</code> is a <strong>manifest</strong> file in which we can specify a bunch of
different metadata about our project. For example, we can say that we depend
on another project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;Your Name &lt;you@example.com&gt;&quot;]

[dependencies]
rand = { git = &quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>This project has a single dependency, on the <code>rand</code> library. We’ve stated in
this case that we’re relying on a particular Git repository that lives on
GitHub. Since we haven’t specified any other information, Cargo assumes that
we intend to use the latest commit on the <code>master</code> branch to build our project.</p>
<p>Sound good? Well, there’s one problem: If you build this project today, and
then you send a copy to me, and I build this project tomorrow, something bad
could happen. There could be more commits to <code>rand</code> in the meantime, and my
build would include new commits while yours would not. Therefore, we would
get different builds. This would be bad because we want reproducible builds.</p>
<p>We could fix this problem by putting a <code>rev</code> line in our <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = { git = &quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git&quot;, rev = &quot;9f35b8e&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Now our builds will be the same. But there’s a big drawback: now we have to
manually think about SHA-1s every time we want to update our library. This is
both tedious and error prone.</p>
<p>Enter the <code>Cargo.lock</code>. Because of its existence, we don’t need to manually
keep track of the exact revisions: Cargo will do it for us. When we have a
manifest like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;Your Name &lt;you@example.com&gt;&quot;]

[dependencies]
rand = { git = &quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo will take the latest commit and write that information out into our
<code>Cargo.lock</code> when we build for the first time. That file will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[package]]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
dependencies = [
 &quot;rand 0.1.0 (git+https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git#9f35b8e439eeedd60b9414c58f389bdc6a3284f9)&quot;,
]

[[package]]
name = &quot;rand&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
source = &quot;git+https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git#9f35b8e439eeedd60b9414c58f389bdc6a3284f9&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that there’s a lot more information here, including the exact
revision we used to build. Now when you give your project to someone else,
they’ll use the exact same SHA, even though we didn’t specify it in our
<code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
<p>When we’re ready to opt in to a new version of the library, Cargo can
re-calculate the dependencies and update things for us:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo update           # updates all dependencies
$ cargo update -p rand   # updates just “rand”
</code></pre>
<p>This will write out a new <code>Cargo.lock</code> with the new version information. Note
that the argument to <code>cargo update</code> is actually a
<a href="reference/pkgid-spec.html">Package ID Specification</a> and <code>rand</code> is just a short
specification.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#tests" id="tests"><h2>Tests</h2></a>
<p>Cargo can run your tests with the <code>cargo test</code> command. Cargo looks for tests
to run in two places: in each of your <code>src</code> files and any tests in <code>tests/</code>.
Tests in your <code>src</code> files should be unit tests, and tests in <code>tests/</code> should be
integration-style tests. As such, you’ll need to import your crates into
the files in <code>tests</code>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of running <code>cargo test</code> in our project, which currently has
no tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo test
   Compiling rand v0.1.0 (https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git#9f35b8e)
   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/project/hello_world)
     Running target/test/hello_world-9c2b65bbb79eabce

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p>If our project had tests, we would see more output with the correct number of
tests.</p>
<p>You can also run a specific test by passing a filter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo test foo
</code></pre>
<p>This will run any test with <code>foo</code> in its name.</p>
<p><code>cargo test</code> runs additional checks as well. For example, it will compile any
examples you’ve included and will also test the examples in your
documentation. Please see the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/testing.html">testing guide</a> in the Rust
documentation for more details.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#continuous-integration" id="continuous-integration"><h2>Continuous Integration</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#travis-ci" id="travis-ci"><h3>Travis CI</h3></a>

<a class="header" href="print.html#specifying-dependencies" id="specifying-dependencies"><h2>Specifying Dependencies</h2></a>
<p>Your crates can depend on other libraries from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, <code>git</code> repositories, or
subdirectories on your local file system. You can also temporarily override the
location of a dependency— for example, to be able to test out a bug fix in the
dependency that you are working on locally. You can have different
dependencies for different platforms, and dependencies that are only used during
development. Let's take a look at how to do each of these.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#specifying-dependencies-from-cratesio" id="specifying-dependencies-from-cratesio"><h3>Specifying dependencies from crates.io</h3></a>
<p>Cargo is configured to look for dependencies on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> by default. Only
the name and a version string are required in this case. In <a href="guide/index.html">the cargo
guide</a>, we specified a dependency on the <code>time</code> crate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
time = &quot;0.1.12&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The string <code>&quot;0.1.12&quot;</code> is a <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik/semver#requirements">semver</a> version requirement. Since this
string does not have any operators in it, it is interpreted the same way as
if we had specified <code>&quot;^0.1.12&quot;</code>, which is called a caret requirement.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#caret-requirements" id="caret-requirements"><h3>Caret requirements</h3></a>
<p><strong>Caret requirements</strong> allow SemVer compatible updates to a specified version.
An update is allowed if the new version number does not modify the left-most
non-zero digit in the major, minor, patch grouping. In this case, if we ran
<code>cargo update -p time</code>, cargo would update us to version <code>0.1.13</code> if it was
available, but would not update us to <code>0.2.0</code>. If instead we had specified the
version string as <code>^1.0</code>, cargo would update to <code>1.1</code> but not <code>2.0</code>. The version
<code>0.0.x</code> is not considered compatible with any other version.</p>
<p>Here are some more examples of caret requirements and the versions that would
be allowed with them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-notrust">^1.2.3 := &gt;=1.2.3 &lt;2.0.0
^1.2 := &gt;=1.2.0 &lt;2.0.0
^1 := &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0
^0.2.3 := &gt;=0.2.3 &lt;0.3.0
^0.0.3 := &gt;=0.0.3 &lt;0.0.4
^0.0 := &gt;=0.0.0 &lt;0.1.0
^0 := &gt;=0.0.0 &lt;1.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>This compatibility convention is different from SemVer in the way it treats
versions before 1.0.0. While SemVer says there is no compatibility before
1.0.0, Cargo considers <code>0.x.y</code> to be compatible with <code>0.x.z</code>, where <code>y ≥ z</code>
and <code>x &gt; 0</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#tilde-requirements" id="tilde-requirements"><h3>Tilde requirements</h3></a>
<p><strong>Tilde requirements</strong> specify a minimal version with some ability to update.
If you specify a major, minor, and patch version or only a major and minor
version, only patch-level changes are allowed. If you only specify a major
version, then minor- and patch-level changes are allowed.</p>
<p><code>~1.2.3</code> is an example of a tilde requirement.</p>
<pre><code class="language-notrust">~1.2.3 := &gt;=1.2.3 &lt;1.3.0
~1.2 := &gt;=1.2.0 &lt;1.3.0
~1 := &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#wildcard-requirements" id="wildcard-requirements"><h3>Wildcard requirements</h3></a>
<p><strong>Wildcard requirements</strong> allow for any version where the wildcard is
positioned.</p>
<p><code>*</code>, <code>1.*</code> and <code>1.2.*</code> are examples of wildcard requirements.</p>
<pre><code class="language-notrust">* := &gt;=0.0.0
1.* := &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0
1.2.* := &gt;=1.2.0 &lt;1.3.0
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#inequality-requirements" id="inequality-requirements"><h3>Inequality requirements</h3></a>
<p><strong>Inequality requirements</strong> allow manually specifying a version range or an
exact version to depend on.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of inequality requirements:</p>
<pre><code class="language-notrust">&gt;= 1.2.0
&gt; 1
&lt; 2
= 1.2.3
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#multiple-requirements" id="multiple-requirements"><h3>Multiple requirements</h3></a>
<p>Multiple version requirements can also be separated with a comma, e.g. <code>&gt;= 1.2, &lt; 1.5</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories" id="specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories"><h3>Specifying dependencies from <code>git</code> repositories</h3></a>
<p>To depend on a library located in a <code>git</code> repository, the minimum information
you need to specify is the location of the repository with the <code>git</code> key:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = { git = &quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo will fetch the <code>git</code> repository at this location then look for a
<code>Cargo.toml</code> for the requested crate anywhere inside the <code>git</code> repository
(not necessarily at the root).</p>
<p>Since we haven’t specified any other information, Cargo assumes that
we intend to use the latest commit on the <code>master</code> branch to build our project.
You can combine the <code>git</code> key with the <code>rev</code>, <code>tag</code>, or <code>branch</code> keys to
specify something else. Here's an example of specifying that you want to use
the latest commit on a branch named <code>next</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = { git = &quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand&quot;, branch = &quot;next&quot; }
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#specifying-path-dependencies" id="specifying-path-dependencies"><h3>Specifying path dependencies</h3></a>
<p>Over time, our <code>hello_world</code> project from <a href="guide/index.html">the guide</a> has
grown significantly in size! It’s gotten to the point that we probably want to
split out a separate crate for others to use. To do this Cargo supports <strong>path
dependencies</strong> which are typically sub-crates that live within one repository.
Let’s start off by making a new crate inside of our <code>hello_world</code> project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell"># inside of hello_world/
$ cargo new hello_utils
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new folder <code>hello_utils</code> inside of which a <code>Cargo.toml</code> and
<code>src</code> folder are ready to be configured. In order to tell Cargo about this, open
up <code>hello_world/Cargo.toml</code> and add <code>hello_utils</code> to your dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
hello_utils = { path = &quot;hello_utils&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>This tells Cargo that we depend on a crate called <code>hello_utils</code> which is found
in the <code>hello_utils</code> folder (relative to the <code>Cargo.toml</code> it’s written in).</p>
<p>And that’s it! The next <code>cargo build</code> will automatically build <code>hello_utils</code> and
all of its own dependencies, and others can also start using the crate as well.
However, crates that use dependencies specified with only a path are not
permitted on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>. If we wanted to publish our <code>hello_world</code> crate, we
would need to publish a version of <code>hello_utils</code> to <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>
and specify its version in the dependencies line as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
hello_utils = { path = &quot;hello_utils&quot;, version = &quot;0.1.0&quot; }
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#overriding-dependencies" id="overriding-dependencies"><h3>Overriding dependencies</h3></a>
<p>There are a number of methods in Cargo to support overriding dependencies and
otherwise controlling the dependency graph. These options are typically, though,
only available at the workspace level and aren't propagated through
dependencies. In other words, &quot;applications&quot; have the ability to override
dependencies but &quot;libraries&quot; do not.</p>
<p>The desire to override a dependency or otherwise alter some dependencies can
arise through a number of scenarios. Most of them, however, boil down to the
ability to work with a crate before it's been published to crates.io. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A crate you're working on is also used in a much larger application you're
working on, and you'd like to test a bug fix to the library inside of the
larger application.</li>
<li>An upstream crate you don't work on has a new feature or a bug fix on the
master branch of its git repository which you'd like to test out.</li>
<li>You're about to publish a new major version of your crate, but you'd like to
do integration testing across an entire project to ensure the new major
version works.</li>
<li>You've submitted a fix to an upstream crate for a bug you found, but you'd
like to immediately have your application start depending on the fixed version
of the crate to avoid blocking on the bug fix getting merged.</li>
</ul>
<p>These scenarios are currently all solved with the <a href="reference/manifest.html#the-patch-section"><code>[patch]</code> manifest
section</a>. Note that the <code>[patch]</code> feature is not yet currently
stable and will be released on 2017-08-31. Historically some of these scenarios
have been solved with <a href="reference/manifest.html#the-replace-section">the <code>[replace]</code> section</a>, but we'll
document the <code>[patch]</code> section here.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#testing-a-bugfix" id="testing-a-bugfix"><h3>Testing a bugfix</h3></a>
<p>Let's say you're working with the [<code>uuid</code>] crate but while you're working on it
you discover a bug. You are, however, quite enterprising so you decide to also
try out to fix the bug! Originally your manifest will look like:</p>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/uuid"><code>uuid</code></a></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;my-library&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;...&quot;]

[dependencies]
uuid = &quot;1.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>First thing we'll do is to clone the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid"><code>uuid</code> repository</a>
locally via:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid
</code></pre>
<p>Next we'll edit the manifest of <code>my-library</code> to contain:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { path = &quot;../path/to/uuid&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Here we declare that we're <em>patching</em> the source <code>crates-io</code> with a new
dependency. This will effectively add the local checked out version of <code>uuid</code> to
the crates.io registry for our local project.</p>
<p>Next up we need to ensure that our lock file is updated to use this new version
of <code>uuid</code> so our project uses the locally checked out copy instead of one from
crates.io. The way <code>[patch]</code> works is that it'll load the dependency at
<code>../path/to/uuid</code> and then whenever crates.io is queried for versions of <code>uuid</code>
it'll <em>also</em> return the local version.</p>
<p>This means that the version number of the local checkout is significant and will
affect whether the patch is used. Our manifest declared <code>uuid = &quot;1.0&quot;</code> which
means we'll only resolve to <code>&gt;= 1.0.0, &lt; 2.0.0</code>, and Cargo's greedy resolution
algorithm also means that we'll resolve to the maximum version within that
range. Typically this doesn't matter as the version of the git repository will
already be greater or match the maximum version published on crates.io, but it's
important to keep this in mind!</p>
<p>In any case, typically all you need to do now is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo build
   Compiling uuid v1.0.0 (file://.../uuid)
   Compiling my-library v0.1.0 (file://.../my-library)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it! You're now building with the local version of <code>uuid</code> (note the
<code>file://</code> in the build output). If you don't see the <code>file://</code> version getting
built then you may need to run <code>cargo update -p uuid --precise $version</code> where
<code>$version</code> is the version of the locally checked out copy of <code>uuid</code>.</p>
<p>Once you've fixed the bug you originally found the next thing you'll want to do
is to likely submit that as a pull request to the <code>uuid</code> crate itself. Once
you've done this then you can also update the <code>[patch]</code> section. The listing
inside of <code>[patch]</code> is just like the <code>[dependencies]</code> section, so once your pull
request is merged you could change your <code>path</code> dependency to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { git = 'https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid' }
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#working-with-an-unpublished-minor-version" id="working-with-an-unpublished-minor-version"><h3>Working with an unpublished minor version</h3></a>
<p>Let's now shift gears a bit from bug fixes to adding features. While working on
<code>my-library</code> you discover that a whole new feature is needed in the <code>uuid</code>
crate. You've implemented this feature, tested it locally above with <code>[patch]</code>,
and submitted a pull request. Let's go over how you continue to use and test it
before it's actually published.</p>
<p>Let's also say that the current version of <code>uuid</code> on crates.io is <code>1.0.0</code>, but
since then the master branch of the git repository has updated to <code>1.0.1</code>. This
branch includes your new feature you submitted previously. To use this
repository we'll edit our <code>Cargo.toml</code> to look like</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;my-library&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;...&quot;]

[dependencies]
uuid = &quot;1.0.1&quot;

[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { git = 'https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid' }
</code></pre>
<p>Note that our local dependency on <code>uuid</code> has been updated to <code>1.0.1</code> as it's
what we'll actually require once the crate is published. This version doesn't
exist on crates.io, though, so we provide it with the <code>[patch]</code> section of the
manifest.</p>
<p>Now when our library is built it'll fetch <code>uuid</code> from the git repository and
resolve to 1.0.1 inside the repository instead of trying to download a version
from crates.io. Once 1.0.1 is published on crates.io the <code>[patch]</code> section can
be deleted.</p>
<p>It's also worth nothing that <code>[patch]</code> applies <em>transitively</em>. Let's say you use
<code>my-library</code> in a larger project, such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;my-binary&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;...&quot;]

[dependencies]
my-library = { git = 'https://example.com/git/my-library' }
uuid = &quot;1.0&quot;

[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { git = 'https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid' }
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that <code>[patch]</code> is only applicable at the <em>top level</em> so we consumers of
<code>my-library</code> have to repeat the <code>[patch]</code> section if necessary. Here, though,
the new <code>uuid</code> crate applies to <em>both</em> our dependency on <code>uuid</code> and the
<code>my-library -&gt; uuid</code> dependency. The <code>uuid</code> crate will be resolved to one
version for this entire crate graph, 1.0.1, and it'll be pulled from the git
repository.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#prepublishing-a-breaking-change" id="prepublishing-a-breaking-change"><h3>Prepublishing a breaking change</h3></a>
<p>As a final scenario, let's take a look at working with a new major version of a
crate, typically accompanied with breaking changes. Sticking with our previous
crates, this means that we're going to be creating version 2.0.0 of the <code>uuid</code>
crate. After we've submitted all changes upstream we can update our manifest for
<code>my-library</code> to look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
uuid = &quot;2.0&quot;

[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { git = &quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid&quot;, branch = &quot;2.0.0&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it! Like with the previous example the 2.0.0 version doesn't actually
exist on crates.io but we can still put it in through a git dependency through
the usage of the <code>[patch]</code> section. As a thought exercise let's take another
look at the <code>my-binary</code> manifest from above again as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;my-binary&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;...&quot;]

[dependencies]
my-library = { git = 'https://example.com/git/my-library' }
uuid = &quot;1.0&quot;

[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { git = 'https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid', version = '2.0.0' }
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this will actually resolve to two versions of the <code>uuid</code> crate. The
<code>my-binary</code> crate will continue to use the 1.x.y series of the <code>uuid</code> crate but
the <code>my-library</code> crate will use the 2.0.0 version of <code>uuid</code>. This will allow you
to gradually roll out breaking changes to a crate through a dependency graph
without being force to update everything all at once.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#overriding-with-local-dependencies" id="overriding-with-local-dependencies"><h3>Overriding with local dependencies</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes you're only temporarily working on a crate and you don't want to have
to modify <code>Cargo.toml</code> like with the <code>[patch]</code> section above. For this use
case Cargo offers a much more limited version of overrides called <strong>path
overrides</strong>.</p>
<p>Path overrides are specified through <code>.cargo/config</code> instead of <code>Cargo.toml</code>,
and you can find <a href="reference/config.html">more documentation about this configuration</a>.
Inside of <code>.cargo/config</code> you'll specify a key called <code>paths</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">paths = [&quot;/path/to/uuid&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>This array should be filled with directories that contain a <code>Cargo.toml</code>. In
this instance, we’re just adding <code>uuid</code>, so it will be the only one that’s
overridden. This path can be either absolute or relative to the directory that
contains the <code>.cargo</code> folder.</p>
<p>Path overrides are more restricted than the <code>[patch]</code> section, however, in
that they cannot change the structure of the dependency graph. When a
path replacement is used then the previous set of dependencies
must all match exactly to the new <code>Cargo.toml</code> specification. For example this
means that path overrides cannot be used to test out adding a dependency to a
crate, instead <code>[patch]</code> must be used in that situation. As a result usage of a
path override is typically isolated to quick bug fixes rather than larger
changes.</p>
<p>Note: using a local configuration to override paths will only work for crates
that have been published to <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>. You cannot use this feature to tell
Cargo how to find local unpublished crates.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#platform-specific-dependencies" id="platform-specific-dependencies"><h3>Platform specific dependencies</h3></a>
<p>Platform-specific dependencies take the same format, but are listed under a
<code>target</code> section. Normally Rust-like <code>#[cfg]</code> syntax will be used to define
these sections:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]
winhttp = &quot;0.4.0&quot;

[target.'cfg(unix)'.dependencies]
openssl = &quot;1.0.1&quot;

[target.'cfg(target_arch = &quot;x86&quot;)'.dependencies]
native = { path = &quot;native/i686&quot; }

[target.'cfg(target_arch = &quot;x86_64&quot;)'.dependencies]
native = { path = &quot;native/x86_64&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Like with Rust, the syntax here supports the <code>not</code>, <code>any</code>, and <code>all</code> operators
to combine various cfg name/value pairs. Note that the <code>cfg</code> syntax has only
been available since Cargo 0.9.0 (Rust 1.8.0).</p>
<p>In addition to <code>#[cfg]</code> syntax, Cargo also supports listing out the full target
the dependencies would apply to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.dependencies]
winhttp = &quot;0.4.0&quot;

[target.i686-unknown-linux-gnu.dependencies]
openssl = &quot;1.0.1&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If you’re using a custom target specification, quote the full path and file
name:</p>

<p>You can add a <code>[dev-dependencies]</code> section to your <code>Cargo.toml</code> whose format

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dev-dependencies]
tempdir = &quot;0.3&quot;

<p>Dev-dependencies are not used when compiling
a package for building, but are used for compiling tests, examples, and
benchmarks.</p>
<p>These dependencies are <em>not</em> propagated to other packages which depend on this
package.</p>
<p>You can also have target-specific development dependencies by using
<code>dev-dependencies</code> in the target section header instead of <code>dependencies</code>. For
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.'cfg(unix)'.dev-dependencies]

<a class="header" href="print.html#build-dependencies" id="build-dependencies"><h3>Build dependencies</h3></a>
<p>You can depend on other Cargo-based crates for use in your build scripts.
Dependencies are declared through the <code>build-dependencies</code> section of the
manifest:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build-dependencies]
gcc = &quot;0.3&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The build script <strong>does not</strong> have access to the dependencies listed
in the <code>dependencies</code> or <code>dev-dependencies</code> section. Build
dependencies will likewise not be available to the package itself
unless listed under the <code>dependencies</code> section as well. A package
itself and its build script are built separately, so their
dependencies need not coincide. Cargo is kept simpler and cleaner by
using independent dependencies for independent purposes.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#choosing-features" id="choosing-features"><h3>Choosing features</h3></a>
<p>If a package you depend on offers conditional features, you can
specify which to use:</p>

<p>Cargo bakes in the concept of <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic
Versioning</a>, so make sure you follow some basic rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you reach 1.0.0, anything goes, but if you make breaking changes,
increment the minor version. In Rust, breaking changes include adding fields to
structs or variants to enums.</li>
<li>After 1.0.0, only make breaking changes when you increment the major version.
Don’t break the build.</li>
<li>After 1.0.0, don’t add any new public API (no new <code>pub</code> anything) in tiny
versions. Always increment the minor version if you add any new <code>pub</code> structs,
traits, fields, types, functions, methods or anything else.</li>
<li>Use version numbers with three numeric parts such as 1.0.0 rather than 1.0.</li>

<p>You can explicitly specify to Cargo that a set of <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/glob/glob/struct.Pattern.html">globs</a> should be
ignored or included for the purposes of packaging and rebuilding a package. The
globs specified in the <code>exclude</code> field identify a set of files that are not
included when a package is published as well as ignored for the purposes of
detecting when to rebuild a package, and the globs in <code>include</code> specify files
that are explicitly included.</p>
<p>If a VCS is being used for a package, the <code>exclude</code> field will be seeded with
the VCS’ ignore settings (<code>.gitignore</code> for git for example).</p>

<p>A feature of a package is either an optional dependency, or a set of other
features. The format for specifying features is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;awesome&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>To use the package <code>awesome</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies.awesome]
version = &quot;1.3.5&quot;
default-features = false # do not include the default features, and optionally
                         # cherry-pick individual features
features = [&quot;secure-password&quot;, &quot;civet&quot;]
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#rules" id="rules"><h4>Rules</h4></a>
<p>The usage of features is subject to a few rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature names must not conflict with other package names in the manifest. This
is because they are opted into via <code>features = [...]</code>, which only has a single
namespace.</li>
<li>With the exception of the <code>default</code> feature, all features are opt-in. To opt
out of the default feature, use <code>default-features = false</code> and cherry-pick
individual features.</li>
<li>Feature groups are not allowed to cyclically depend on one another.</li>
<li>Dev-dependencies cannot be optional.</li>
<li>Features groups can only reference optional dependencies.</li>
<li>When a feature is selected, Cargo will call <code>rustc</code> with <code>--cfg feature=&quot;${feature_name}&quot;</code>. If a feature group is included, it and all of its
individual features will be included. This can be tested in code via
<code>#[cfg(feature = &quot;foo&quot;)]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that it is explicitly allowed for features to not actually activate any
optional dependencies. This allows packages to internally enable/disable
features without requiring a new dependency.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#usage-in-end-products" id="usage-in-end-products"><h4>Usage in end products</h4></a>
<p>One major use-case for this feature is specifying optional features in
end-products. For example, the Servo project may want to include optional
features that people can enable or disable when they build it.</p>
<p>In that case, Servo will describe features in its <code>Cargo.toml</code> and they can be
enabled using command-line flags:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo build --release --features &quot;shumway pdf&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Default features could be excluded using <code>--no-default-features</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#usage-in-packages" id="usage-in-packages"><h4>Usage in packages</h4></a>
<p>In most cases, the concept of <em>optional dependency</em> in a library is best
expressed as a separate package that the top-level application depends on.</p>
<p>However, high-level packages, like Iron or Piston, may want the ability to
curate a number of packages for easy installation. The current Cargo system
allows them to curate a number of mandatory dependencies into a single package
for easy installation.</p>
<p>In some cases, packages may want to provide additional curation for optional
dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>grouping a number of low-level optional dependencies together into a single
high-level feature;</li>
<li>specifying packages that are recommended (or suggested) to be included by
users of the package; and</li>
<li>including a feature (like <code>secure-password</code> in the motivating example) that
will only work if an optional dependency is available, and would be difficult
to implement as a separate package (for example, it may be overly difficult to
design an IO package to be completely decoupled from OpenSSL, with opt-in via
the inclusion of a separate package).</li>
</ul>
<p>In almost all cases, it is an antipattern to use these features outside of
high-level packages that are designed for curation. If a feature is optional, it
can almost certainly be expressed as a separate package.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-workspace-section" id="the-workspace-section"><h3>The <code>[workspace]</code> section</h3></a>
<p>Projects can define a workspace which is a set of crates that will all share the
same <code>Cargo.lock</code> and output directory. The <code>[workspace]</code> table can be defined
as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[workspace]

# Optional key, inferred if not present
members = [&quot;path/to/member1&quot;, &quot;path/to/member2&quot;, &quot;path/to/member3/*&quot;]

# Optional key, empty if not present
exclude = [&quot;path1&quot;, &quot;path/to/dir2&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Workspaces were added to Cargo as part of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1525-cargo-workspace.md">RFC 1525</a> and have a number of
properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A workspace can contain multiple crates where one of them is the <em>root crate</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>root crate</em>'s <code>Cargo.toml</code> contains the <code>[workspace]</code> table, but is not
required to have other configuration.</li>
<li>Whenever any crate in the workspace is compiled, output is placed in the
<em>workspace root</em>. i.e. next to the <em>root crate</em>'s <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</li>
<li>The lock file for all crates in the workspace resides in the <em>workspace root</em>.</li>
<li>The <code>[patch]</code> and <code>[replace]</code> sections in <code>Cargo.toml</code> are only recognized
in the <em>root crate</em>'s manifest, and ignored in member crates' manifests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>root crate</em> of a workspace, indicated by the presence of <code>[workspace]</code> in
its manifest, is responsible for defining the entire workspace. All <code>path</code>
dependencies residing in the workspace directory become members. You can add
additional packages to the workspace by listing them in the <code>members</code> key. Note
that members of the workspaces listed explicitly will also have their path
dependencies included in the workspace. Sometimes a project may have a lot of
workspace members and it can be onerous to keep up to date. The path dependency
can also use <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/glob/glob/struct.Pattern.html">globs</a> to match multiple paths. Finally, the <code>exclude</code>
key can be used to blacklist paths from being included in a workspace. This can
be useful if some path dependencies aren't desired to be in the workspace at
all.</p>
<p>The <code>package.workspace</code> manifest key (described above) is used in member crates
to point at a workspace's root crate. If this key is omitted then it is inferred
to be the first crate whose manifest contains <code>[workspace]</code> upwards in the
filesystem.</p>
<p>A crate may either specify <code>package.workspace</code> or specify <code>[workspace]</code>. That
is, a crate cannot both be a root crate in a workspace (contain <code>[workspace]</code>)
and also be a member crate of another workspace (contain <code>package.workspace</code>).</p>
<p>Most of the time workspaces will not need to be dealt with as <code>cargo new</code> and
<code>cargo init</code> will handle workspace configuration automatically.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#virtual-manifest" id="virtual-manifest"><h4>Virtual Manifest</h4></a>
<p>In workspace manifests, if the <code>package</code> table is present, the workspace root
crate will be treated as a normal package, as well as a worksapce. If the
<code>package</code> table is not present in a worksapce manifest, it is called a <em>virtual
manifest</em>.</p>
<p>When working with <em>virtual manifests</em>, package-related cargo commands, like
<code>cargo build</code>, won't be available anymore. But, most of such commands support
the <code>--all</code> option, will execute the command for all the non-virtual manifest in
the workspace.</p>
<p>#TODO: move this to a more appropriate place</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-project-layout" id="the-project-layout"><h3>The project layout</h3></a>
<p>If your project is an executable, name the main source file <code>src/main.rs</code>. If it
is a library, name the main source file <code>src/lib.rs</code>.</p>
<p>Cargo will also treat any files located in <code>src/bin/*.rs</code> as executables. If your
executable consists of more than just one source file, you might also use a directory
inside <code>src/bin</code> containing a <code>main.rs</code> file which will be treated as an executable
with a name of the parent directory.
Do note, however, once you add a <code>[[bin]]</code> section (<a href="print.html#configuring-a-target">see
below</a>), Cargo will no longer automatically build files
located in <code>src/bin/*.rs</code>.  Instead you must create a <code>[[bin]]</code> section for
each file you want to build.</p>
<p>Your project can optionally contain folders named <code>examples</code>, <code>tests</code>, and
<code>benches</code>, which Cargo will treat as containing examples,
integration tests, and benchmarks respectively.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">▾ src/           # directory containing source files
  lib.rs         # the main entry point for libraries and packages
  main.rs        # the main entry point for projects producing executables
  ▾ bin/         # (optional) directory containing additional executables
    *.rs

▾ benches/       # (optional) benchmarks
  *.rs
</code></pre>
<p>To structure your code after you've created the files and folders for your
project, you should remember to use Rust's module system, which you can read
about in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/crates-and-modules.html">the book</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#examples" id="examples"><h3>Examples</h3></a>
<p>Files located under <code>examples</code> are example uses of the functionality provided by
the library. When compiled, they are placed in the <code>target/examples</code> directory.</p>
<p>They can compile either as executables (with a <code>main()</code> function) or libraries
and pull in the library by using <code>extern crate &lt;library-name&gt;</code>. They are
compiled when you run your tests to protect them from bitrotting.</p>
<p>You can run individual executable examples with the command <code>cargo run --example &lt;example-name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Specify <code>crate-type</code> to make an example be compiled as a library:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[example]]
name = &quot;foo&quot;
crate-type = [&quot;staticlib&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>You can build individual library examples with the command <code>cargo build --example &lt;example-name&gt;</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#tests-1" id="tests-1"><h3>Tests</h3></a>
<p>When you run <code>cargo test</code>, Cargo will:</p>
<ul>
<li>compile and run your library’s unit tests, which are in the files reachable
from <code>lib.rs</code> (naturally, any sections marked with <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> will be
considered at this stage);</li>
<li>compile and run your library’s documentation tests, which are embedded inside
of documentation blocks;</li>
<li>compile and run your library’s <a href="print.html#integration-tests">integration tests</a>; and</li>
<li>compile your library’s examples.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#integration-tests" id="integration-tests"><h4>Integration tests</h4></a>
<p>Each file in <code>tests/*.rs</code> is an integration test. When you run <code>cargo test</code>,
Cargo will compile each of these files as a separate crate. The crate can link
to your library by using <code>extern crate &lt;library-name&gt;</code>, like any other code that
depends on it.</p>
<p>Cargo will not automatically compile files inside subdirectories of <code>tests</code>, but
an integration test can import modules from these directories as usual. For
example, if you want several integration tests to share some code, you can put
the shared code in <code>tests/common/mod.rs</code> and then put <code>mod common;</code> in each of
the test files.</p>

<p>All of the  <code>[[bin]]</code>, <code>[lib]</code>, <code>[[bench]]</code>, <code>[[test]]</code>, and <code>[[example]]</code>

built. The double-bracket sections like <code>[[bin]]</code> are array-of-table of

<a class="header" href="print.html#the-patch-section" id="the-patch-section"><h3>The <code>[patch]</code> Section</h3></a>
<p>This section of Cargo.toml can be used to <a href="reference/specifying-dependencies.html#overriding-dependencies">override dependencies</a> with
other copies. The syntax is similar to the <code>[dependencies]</code> section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[patch.crates-io]
foo = { git = 'https://github.com/example/foo' }
bar = { path = 'my/local/bar' }
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>[patch]</code> table is made of dependency-like sub-tables. Each key after
<code>[patch]</code> is a URL of the source that's being patched, or <code>crates-io</code> if
you're modifying the https://crates.io registry. In the example above
<code>crates-io</code> could be replaced with a git URL such as
<code>https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/log</code>.</p>
<p>Each entry in these tables is a normal dependency specification, the same as
found in the <code>[dependencies]</code> section of the manifest. The dependencies listed
in the <code>[patch]</code> section are resolved and used to patch the source at the
URL specified. The above manifest snippet patches the <code>crates-io</code> source (e.g.
crates.io itself) with the <code>foo</code> crate and <code>bar</code> crate.</p>
<p>Sources can be patched with versions of crates that do not exist, and they can
also be patched with versions of crates that already exist. If a source is
patched with a crate version that already exists in the source, then the
source's original crate is replaced.</p>
<p>More information about overriding dependencies can be found in the <a href="reference/specifying-dependencies.html#overriding-dependencies">overriding
dependencies</a> section of the documentation and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1969">RFC 1969</a> for the
technical specification of this feature. (Note that the <code>[patch]</code> feature will
first become available in Rust 1.21, set to be released on 2017-10-12.)</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Each key in the <code>[replace]</code> table is a <a href="reference/pkgid-spec.html">package id
specification</a> which allows arbitrarily choosing a node in the
dependency graph to override. The value of each key is the same as the
<code>[dependencies]</code> syntax for specifying dependencies, except that you can't
specify features. Note that when a crate is overridden the copy it's overridden
with must have both the same name and version, but it can come from a different
source (e.g. git or a local path).</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#configuration" id="configuration"><h2>Configuration</h2></a>
<p>This document will explain how Cargo’s configuration system works, as well as
available keys or configuration.  For configuration of a project through its
manifest, see the <a href="reference/manifest.html">manifest format</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#hierarchical-structure" id="hierarchical-structure"><h3>Hierarchical structure</h3></a>
<p>Cargo allows local configuration for a particular project as well as global
configuration, like git. Cargo extends this to a hierarchical strategy.
If, for example, Cargo were invoked in <code>/projects/foo/bar/baz</code>, then the
following configuration files would be probed for and unified in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/projects/foo/bar/baz/.cargo/config</code></li>
<li><code>/projects/foo/bar/.cargo/config</code></li>
<li><code>/projects/foo/.cargo/config</code></li>
<li><code>/projects/.cargo/config</code></li>
<li><code>/.cargo/config</code></li>
<li><code>$HOME/.cargo/config</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With this structure, you can specify configuration per-project, and even
possibly check it into version control. You can also specify personal defaults
with a configuration file in your home directory.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#configuration-format" id="configuration-format"><h3>Configuration format</h3></a>
<p>All configuration is currently in the <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML format</a> (like the manifest),
with simple key-value pairs inside of sections (tables) which all get merged
together.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#configuration-keys" id="configuration-keys"><h3>Configuration keys</h3></a>
<p>All of the following keys are optional, and their defaults are listed as their
value unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>Key values that specify a tool may be given as an absolute path, a relative path
or as a pathless tool name. Absolute paths and pathless tool names are used as
given. Relative paths are resolved relative to the parent directory of the
<code>.cargo</code> directory of the config file that the value resides within.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#environment-variables" id="environment-variables"><h3>Environment variables</h3></a>
<p>Cargo can also be configured through environment variables in addition to the
TOML syntax above. For each configuration key above of the form <code>foo.bar</code> the
environment variable <code>CARGO_FOO_BAR</code> can also be used to define the value. For
example the <code>build.jobs</code> key can also be defined by <code>CARGO_BUILD_JOBS</code>.</p>
<p>Environment variables will take precedent over TOML configuration, and currently
only integer, boolean, and string keys are supported to be defined by
environment variables.</p>
<p>In addition to the system above, Cargo recognizes a few other specific
<a href="reference/environment-variables.html">environment variables</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#environment-variables-1" id="environment-variables-1"><h2>Environment Variables</h2></a>
<p>Cargo sets and reads a number of environment variables which your code can detect
or override. Here is a list of the variables Cargo sets, organized by when it interacts
with them:</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#environment-variables-cargo-reads" id="environment-variables-cargo-reads"><h3>Environment variables Cargo reads</h3></a>
<p>You can override these environment variables to change Cargo's behavior on your
system:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CARGO_HOME</code> - Cargo maintains a local cache of the registry index and of git
checkouts of crates.  By default these are stored under <code>$HOME/.cargo</code>, but
this variable overrides the location of this directory. Once a crate is cached
it is not removed by the clean command.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_TARGET_DIR</code> - Location of where to place all generated artifacts,
relative to the current working directory.</li>
<li><code>RUSTC</code> - Instead of running <code>rustc</code>, Cargo will execute this specified
compiler instead.</li>
<li><code>RUSTC_WRAPPER</code> - Instead of simply running <code>rustc</code>, Cargo will execute this
specified wrapper instead, passing as its commandline arguments the rustc
invocation, with the first argument being rustc.</li>
<li><code>RUSTDOC</code> - Instead of running <code>rustdoc</code>, Cargo will execute this specified
<code>rustdoc</code> instance instead.</li>
<li><code>RUSTDOCFLAGS</code> - A space-separated list of custom flags to pass to all <code>rustdoc</code>
invocations that Cargo performs. In contrast with <code>cargo rustdoc</code>, this is
useful for passing a flag to <em>all</em> <code>rustdoc</code> instances.</li>
<li><code>RUSTFLAGS</code> - A space-separated list of custom flags to pass to all compiler
invocations that Cargo performs. In contrast with <code>cargo rustc</code>, this is
useful for passing a flag to <em>all</em> compiler instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Cargo will also read environment variables for <code>.cargo/config</code>
configuration values, as described in <a href="reference/config.html#environment-variables">that documentation</a></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates" id="environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates"><h3>Environment variables Cargo sets for crates</h3></a>
<p>Cargo exposes these environment variables to your crate when it is compiled.
Note that this applies for test binaries as well.
To get the value of any of these variables in a Rust program, do this:</p>

# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let version = env!(&quot;CARGO_PKG_VERSION&quot;);

<li><code>CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR</code> - The directory containing the manifest of your package.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_PKG_VERSION</code> - The full version of your package.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_PKG_VERSION_MAJOR</code> - The major version of your package.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_PKG_VERSION_MINOR</code> - The minor version of your package.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PATCH</code> - The patch version of your package.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PRE</code> - The pre-release version of your package.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_PKG_AUTHORS</code> - Colon separated list of authors from the manifest of your package.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_PKG_NAME</code> - The name of your package.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_PKG_DESCRIPTION</code> - The description of your package.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_PKG_HOMEPAGE</code> - The home page of your package.</li>
<li><code>OUT_DIR</code> - If the package has a build script, this is set to the folder where the build
script should place its output.  See below for more information.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-build-scripts" id="environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-build-scripts"><h3>Environment variables Cargo sets for build scripts</h3></a>
<p>Cargo sets several environment variables when build scripts are run. Because these variables
are not yet set when the build script is compiled, the above example using <code>env!</code> won't work

let out_dir = env::var(&quot;OUT_DIR&quot;).unwrap();

<ul>
<li><code>CARGO</code> - Path to the <code>cargo</code> binary performing the build.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR</code> - The directory containing the manifest for the package
being built (the package containing the build
script). Also note that this is the value of the
current working directory of the build script when it
starts.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_MANIFEST_LINKS</code> - the manifest <code>links</code> value.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_FEATURE_&lt;name&gt;</code> - For each activated feature of the package being
built, this environment variable will be present
where <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is the name of the feature uppercased
and having <code>-</code> translated to <code>_</code>.</li>
<li><code>CARGO_CFG_&lt;cfg&gt;</code> - For each <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes.html#conditional-compilation">configuration option</a> of the
package being built, this environment variable will
contain the value of the configuration, where <code>&lt;cfg&gt;</code> is
the name of the configuration uppercased and having <code>-</code>
translated to <code>_</code>.
Boolean configurations are present if they are set, and
not present otherwise.
Configurations with multiple values are joined to a
single variable with the values delimited by <code>,</code>.</li>
<li><code>OUT_DIR</code> - the folder in which all output should be placed. This folder is
inside the build directory for the package being built, and it is
unique for the package in question.</li>
<li><code>TARGET</code> - the target triple that is being compiled for. Native code should be
compiled for this triple. Some more information about target
triples can be found in <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html#target-triple">clang’s own documentation</a>.</li>
<li><code>HOST</code> - the host triple of the rust compiler.</li>
<li><code>NUM_JOBS</code> - the parallelism specified as the top-level parallelism. This can
be useful to pass a <code>-j</code> parameter to a system like <code>make</code>. Note
that care should be taken when interpreting this environment
variable. For historical purposes this is still provided but
recent versions of Cargo, for example, do not need to run <code>make -j</code> as it'll automatically happen. Cargo implements its own
[jobserver] and will allow build scripts to inherit this
information, so programs compatible with GNU make jobservers will
already have appropriately configured parallelism.</li>
<li><code>OPT_LEVEL</code>, <code>DEBUG</code> - values of the corresponding variables for the
profile currently being built.</li>
<li><code>PROFILE</code> - <code>release</code> for release builds, <code>debug</code> for other builds.</li>
<li><code>DEP_&lt;name&gt;_&lt;key&gt;</code> - For more information about this set of environment
variables, see build script documentation about <a href="reference/build-scripts.html#the-links-manifest-key"><code>links</code></a>.</li>

</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#build-scripts" id="build-scripts"><h2>Build Scripts</h2></a>
<p>Some packages need to compile third-party non-Rust code, for example C
libraries. Other packages need to link to C libraries which can either be
located on the system or possibly need to be built from source. Others still
need facilities for functionality such as code generation before building (think
parser generators).</p>
<p>Cargo does not aim to replace other tools that are well-optimized for
these tasks, but it does integrate with them with the <code>build</code> configuration
option.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
# ...
build = &quot;build.rs&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The Rust file designated by the <code>build</code> command (relative to the package root)
will be compiled and invoked before anything else is compiled in the package,
allowing your Rust code to depend on the built or generated artifacts.
By default Cargo looks up for <code>&quot;build.rs&quot;</code> file in a package root (even if you
do not specify a value for <code>build</code>). Use <code>build = &quot;custom_build_name.rs&quot;</code> to specify
a custom build name or <code>build = false</code> to disable automatic detection of the build script.</p>
<p>Some example use cases of the build command are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a bundled C library.</li>
<li>Finding a C library on the host system.</li>
<li>Generating a Rust module from a specification.</li>
<li>Performing any platform-specific configuration needed for the crate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these use cases will be detailed in full below to give examples of how
the build command works.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#inputs-to-the-build-script" id="inputs-to-the-build-script"><h3>Inputs to the Build Script</h3></a>
<p>When the build script is run, there are a number of inputs to the build script,
all passed in the form of <a href="reference/environment-variables.html">environment variables</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to environment variables, the build script’s current directory is
the source directory of the build script’s package.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#outputs-of-the-build-script" id="outputs-of-the-build-script"><h3>Outputs of the Build Script</h3></a>
<p>All the lines printed to stdout by a build script are written to a file like
<code>target/debug/build/&lt;pkg&gt;/output</code> (the precise location may depend on your
configuration). Any line that starts with <code>cargo:</code> is interpreted directly by
Cargo. This line must be of the form <code>cargo:key=value</code>, like the examples below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell"># specially recognized by Cargo
cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=foo
cargo:rustc-link-search=native=/path/to/foo
cargo:rustc-cfg=foo
cargo:rustc-env=FOO=bar
# arbitrary user-defined metadata
cargo:root=/path/to/foo
cargo:libdir=/path/to/foo/lib
cargo:include=/path/to/foo/include
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, lines printed to stderr are written to a file like
<code>target/debug/build/&lt;pkg&gt;/stderr</code> but are not interpreted by cargo.</p>
<p>There are a few special keys that Cargo recognizes, some affecting how the
crate is built:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>rustc-link-lib=[KIND=]NAME</code> indicates that the specified value is a library
name and should be passed to the compiler as a <code>-l</code> flag. The optional <code>KIND</code>
can be one of <code>static</code>, <code>dylib</code> (the default), or <code>framework</code>, see
<code>rustc --help</code> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rustc-link-search=[KIND=]PATH</code> indicates the specified value is a library
search path and should be passed to the compiler as a <code>-L</code> flag. The optional
<code>KIND</code> can be one of <code>dependency</code>, <code>crate</code>, <code>native</code>, <code>framework</code> or <code>all</code>
(the default), see <code>rustc --help</code> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rustc-flags=FLAGS</code> is a set of flags passed to the compiler, only <code>-l</code> and
<code>-L</code> flags are supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rustc-cfg=FEATURE</code> indicates that the specified feature will be passed as a
<code>--cfg</code> flag to the compiler. This is often useful for performing compile-time
detection of various features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rustc-env=VAR=VALUE</code> indicates that the specified environment variable
will be added to the environment which the compiler is run within.
The value can be then retrieved by the <code>env!</code> macro in the compiled crate.
This is useful for embedding additional metadata in crate's code,
such as the hash of Git HEAD or the unique identifier of a continuous
integration server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rerun-if-changed=PATH</code> is a path to a file or directory which indicates that
the build script should be re-run if it changes (detected by a more-recent
last-modified timestamp on the file). Normally build scripts are re-run if
any file inside the crate root changes, but this can be used to scope changes
to just a small set of files. (If this path points to a directory the entire
directory will not be traversed for changes -- only changes to the timestamp
of the directory itself (which corresponds to some types of changes within the
directory, depending on platform) will trigger a rebuild. To request a re-run
on any changes within an entire directory, print a line for the directory and
another line for everything inside it, recursively.)
Note that if the build script itself (or one of its dependencies) changes,
then it's rebuilt and rerun unconditionally, so
<code>cargo:rerun-if-changed=build.rs</code> is almost always redundant (unless you
want to ignore changes in all other files except for <code>build.rs</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rerun-if-env-changed=VAR</code> is the name of an environment variable which
indicates that if the environment variable's value changes the build script
should be rerun. This basically behaves the same as <code>rerun-if-changed</code> except
that it works with environment variables instead. Note that the environment
variables here are intended for global environment variables like <code>CC</code> and
such, it's not necessary to use this for env vars like <code>TARGET</code> that Cargo
sets. Also note that if <code>rerun-if-env-changed</code> is printed out then Cargo will
<em>only</em> rerun the build script if those environment variables change or if
files printed out by <code>rerun-if-changed</code> change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>warning=MESSAGE</code> is a message that will be printed to the main console after
a build script has finished running. Warnings are only shown for path
dependencies (that is, those you're working on locally), so for example
warnings printed out in crates.io crates are not emitted by default.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other element is a user-defined metadata that will be passed to
dependents. More information about this can be found in the <a href="print.html#the-links-manifest-key"><code>links</code></a>
section.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#build-dependencies-1" id="build-dependencies-1"><h3>Build Dependencies</h3></a>
<p>Build scripts are also allowed to have dependencies on other Cargo-based crates.
Dependencies are declared through the <code>build-dependencies</code> section of the
manifest.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build-dependencies]
foo = { git = &quot;https://github.com/your-packages/foo&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>The build script <strong>does not</strong> have access to the dependencies listed in the
<code>dependencies</code> or <code>dev-dependencies</code> section (they’re not built yet!). All build
dependencies will also not be available to the package itself unless explicitly
stated as so.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-links-manifest-key" id="the-links-manifest-key"><h3>The <code>links</code> Manifest Key</h3></a>
<p>In addition to the manifest key <code>build</code>, Cargo also supports a <code>links</code> manifest
key to declare the name of a native library that is being linked to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
# ...
links = &quot;foo&quot;
build = &quot;build.rs&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This manifest states that the package links to the <code>libfoo</code> native library, and
it also has a build script for locating and/or building the library. Cargo
requires that a <code>build</code> command is specified if a <code>links</code> entry is also
specified.</p>
<p>The purpose of this manifest key is to give Cargo an understanding about the set
of native dependencies that a package has, as well as providing a principled
system of passing metadata between package build scripts.</p>
<p>Primarily, Cargo requires that there is at most one package per <code>links</code> value.
In other words, it’s forbidden to have two packages link to the same native
library. Note, however, that there are <a href="print.html#-sys-packages">conventions in place</a> to
alleviate this.</p>
<p>As mentioned above in the output format, each build script can generate an
arbitrary set of metadata in the form of key-value pairs. This metadata is
passed to the build scripts of <strong>dependent</strong> packages. For example, if <code>libbar</code>
depends on <code>libfoo</code>, then if <code>libfoo</code> generates <code>key=value</code> as part of its
metadata, then the build script of <code>libbar</code> will have the environment variables
<code>DEP_FOO_KEY=value</code>.</p>
<p>Note that metadata is only passed to immediate dependents, not transitive
dependents. The motivation for this metadata passing is outlined in the linking
to system libraries case study below.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#overriding-build-scripts" id="overriding-build-scripts"><h3>Overriding Build Scripts</h3></a>
<p>If a manifest contains a <code>links</code> key, then Cargo supports overriding the build
script specified with a custom library. The purpose of this functionality is to
prevent running the build script in question altogether and instead supply the
metadata ahead of time.</p>
<p>To override a build script, place the following configuration in any acceptable
Cargo <a href="reference/config.html">configuration location</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.foo]
rustc-link-search = [&quot;/path/to/foo&quot;]
rustc-link-lib = [&quot;foo&quot;]
root = &quot;/path/to/foo&quot;
key = &quot;value&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This section states that for the target <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code> the library
named <code>foo</code> has the metadata specified. This metadata is the same as the
metadata generated as if the build script had run, providing a number of
key/value pairs where the <code>rustc-flags</code>, <code>rustc-link-search</code>, and
<code>rustc-link-lib</code> keys are slightly special.</p>
<p>With this configuration, if a package declares that it links to <code>foo</code> then the
build script will <strong>not</strong> be compiled or run, and the metadata specified will
instead be used.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#case-study-code-generation" id="case-study-code-generation"><h3>Case study: Code generation</h3></a>
<p>Some Cargo packages need to have code generated just before they are compiled
for various reasons. Here we’ll walk through a simple example which generates a
library call as part of the build script.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the directory structure of this package:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">.
├── Cargo.toml
├── build.rs
└── src
    └── main.rs

1 directory, 3 files
</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see that we have a <code>build.rs</code> build script and our binary in
<code>main.rs</code>. Next, let’s take a look at the manifest:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># Cargo.toml

[package]
name = &quot;hello-from-generated-code&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;you@example.com&quot;]
build = &quot;build.rs&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see we’ve got a build script specified which we’ll use to generate
some code. Let’s see what’s inside the build script:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust no_run">// build.rs

use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let out_dir = env::var(&quot;OUT_DIR&quot;).unwrap();
    let dest_path = Path::new(&amp;out_dir).join(&quot;hello.rs&quot;);
    let mut f = File::create(&amp;dest_path).unwrap();

    f.write_all(b&quot;
        pub fn message() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
            \&quot;Hello, World!\&quot;
        }
    &quot;).unwrap();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>There’s a couple of points of note here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The script uses the <code>OUT_DIR</code> environment variable to discover where the
output files should be located. It can use the process’ current working
directory to find where the input files should be located, but in this case we
don’t have any input files.</li>
<li>This script is relatively simple as it just writes out a small generated file.
One could imagine that other more fanciful operations could take place such as
generating a Rust module from a C header file or another language definition,
for example.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let’s peek at the library itself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// src/main.rs

include!(concat!(env!(&quot;OUT_DIR&quot;), &quot;/hello.rs&quot;));

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, message());
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is where the real magic happens. The library is using the rustc-defined
<code>include!</code> macro in combination with the <code>concat!</code> and <code>env!</code> macros to include
the generated file (<code>hello.rs</code>) into the crate’s compilation.</p>
<p>Using the structure shown here, crates can include any number of generated files
from the build script itself.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#case-study-building-some-native-code" id="case-study-building-some-native-code"><h3>Case study: Building some native code</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes it’s necessary to build some native C or C++ code as part of a
package. This is another excellent use case of leveraging the build script to
build a native library before the Rust crate itself. As an example, we’ll create
a Rust library which calls into C to print “Hello, World!”.</p>
<p>Like above, let’s first take a look at the project layout:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">.
├── Cargo.toml
├── build.rs
└── src
    ├── hello.c
    └── main.rs

1 directory, 4 files
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty similar to before! Next, the manifest:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># Cargo.toml

[package]
name = &quot;hello-world-from-c&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;you@example.com&quot;]
build = &quot;build.rs&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>For now we’re not going to use any build dependencies, so let’s take a look at
the build script now:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust no_run">// build.rs

use std::process::Command;
use std::env;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let out_dir = env::var(&quot;OUT_DIR&quot;).unwrap();

    // note that there are a number of downsides to this approach, the comments
    // below detail how to improve the portability of these commands.
    Command::new(&quot;gcc&quot;).args(&amp;[&quot;src/hello.c&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;-fPIC&quot;, &quot;-o&quot;])
                       .arg(&amp;format!(&quot;{}/hello.o&quot;, out_dir))
                       .status().unwrap();
    Command::new(&quot;ar&quot;).args(&amp;[&quot;crus&quot;, &quot;libhello.a&quot;, &quot;hello.o&quot;])
                      .current_dir(&amp;Path::new(&amp;out_dir))
                      .status().unwrap();

    println!(&quot;cargo:rustc-link-search=native={}&quot;, out_dir);
    println!(&quot;cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=hello&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This build script starts out by compiling our C file into an object file (by
invoking <code>gcc</code>) and then converting this object file into a static library (by
invoking <code>ar</code>). The final step is feedback to Cargo itself to say that our
output was in <code>out_dir</code> and the compiler should link the crate to <code>libhello.a</code>
statically via the <code>-l static=hello</code> flag.</p>
<p>Note that there are a number of drawbacks to this hardcoded approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>gcc</code> command itself is not portable across platforms. For example it’s
unlikely that Windows platforms have <code>gcc</code>, and not even all Unix platforms
may have <code>gcc</code>. The <code>ar</code> command is also in a similar situation.</li>
<li>These commands do not take cross-compilation into account. If we’re cross
compiling for a platform such as Android it’s unlikely that <code>gcc</code> will produce
an ARM executable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to fear, though, this is where a <code>build-dependencies</code> entry would help! The
Cargo ecosystem has a number of packages to make this sort of task much easier,
portable, and standardized. For example, the build script could be written as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// build.rs

// Bring in a dependency on an externally maintained `gcc` package which manages
// invoking the C compiler.
extern crate gcc;

fn main() {
    gcc::compile_library(&quot;libhello.a&quot;, &amp;[&quot;src/hello.c&quot;]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Add a build time dependency on the <code>gcc</code> crate with the following addition to
your <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build-dependencies]
gcc = &quot;0.3&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/gcc"><code>gcc</code> crate</a> abstracts a range of build
script requirements for C code:</p>
<ul>
<li>It invokes the appropriate compiler (MSVC for windows, <code>gcc</code> for MinGW, <code>cc</code>
for Unix platforms, etc.).</li>
<li>It takes the <code>TARGET</code> variable into account by passing appropriate flags to
the compiler being used.</li>
<li>Other environment variables, such as <code>OPT_LEVEL</code>, <code>DEBUG</code>, etc., are all
handled automatically.</li>
<li>The stdout output and <code>OUT_DIR</code> locations are also handled by the <code>gcc</code>
library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we can start to see some of the major benefits of farming as much
functionality as possible out to common build dependencies rather than
duplicating logic across all build scripts!</p>
<p>Back to the case study though, let’s take a quick look at the contents of the
<code>src</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// src/hello.c

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void hello() {
    printf(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// src/main.rs

// Note the lack of the `#[link]` attribute. We’re delegating the responsibility
// of selecting what to link to over to the build script rather than hardcoding
// it in the source file.
extern { fn hello(); }

fn main() {
    unsafe { hello(); }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And there we go! This should complete our example of building some C code from a
Cargo package using the build script itself. This also shows why using a build
dependency can be crucial in many situations and even much more concise!</p>
<p>We’ve also seen a brief example of how a build script can use a crate as a
dependency purely for the build process and not for the crate itself at runtime.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#case-study-linking-to-system-libraries" id="case-study-linking-to-system-libraries"><h3>Case study: Linking to system libraries</h3></a>
<p>The final case study here will be investigating how a Cargo library links to a
system library and how the build script is leveraged to support this use case.</p>
<p>Quite frequently a Rust crate wants to link to a native library often provided
on the system to bind its functionality or just use it as part of an
implementation detail. This is quite a nuanced problem when it comes to
performing this in a platform-agnostic fashion, and the purpose of a build
script is again to farm out as much of this as possible to make this as easy as
possible for consumers.</p>
<p>As an example to follow, let’s take a look at one of <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/git2-rs/tree/master/libgit2-sys">Cargo’s own
dependencies</a>, <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2">libgit2</a>. The C library has a number of
constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has an optional dependency on OpenSSL on Unix to implement the https
transport.</li>
<li>It has an optional dependency on libssh2 on all platforms to implement the ssh
transport.</li>
<li>It is often not installed on all systems by default.</li>
<li>It can be built from source using <code>cmake</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To visualize what’s going on here, let’s take a look at the manifest for the
relevant Cargo package that links to the native C library.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;libgit2-sys&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;...&quot;]
links = &quot;git2&quot;
build = &quot;build.rs&quot;

[dependencies]
libssh2-sys = { git = &quot;https://github.com/alexcrichton/ssh2-rs&quot; }

[target.'cfg(unix)'.dependencies]
openssl-sys = { git = &quot;https://github.com/alexcrichton/openssl-sys&quot; }

# ...
</code></pre>
<p>As the above manifests show, we’ve got a <code>build</code> script specified, but it’s
worth noting that this example has a <code>links</code> entry which indicates that the
crate (<code>libgit2-sys</code>) links to the <code>git2</code> native library.</p>
<p>Here we also see that we chose to have the Rust crate have an unconditional
dependency on <code>libssh2</code> via the <code>libssh2-sys</code> crate, as well as a
platform-specific dependency on <code>openssl-sys</code> for *nix (other variants elided
for now). It may seem a little counterintuitive to express <em>C dependencies</em> in
the <em>Cargo manifest</em>, but this is actually using one of Cargo’s conventions in
this space.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#-sys-packages" id="-sys-packages"><h3><code>*-sys</code> Packages</h3></a>
<p>To alleviate linking to system libraries, Cargo has a <em>convention</em> of package
naming and functionality. Any package named <code>foo-sys</code> will provide two major
pieces of functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>The library crate will link to the native library <code>libfoo</code>. This will often
probe the current system for <code>libfoo</code> before resorting to building from
source.</li>
<li>The library crate will provide <strong>declarations</strong> for functions in <code>libfoo</code>,
but it does <strong>not</strong> provide bindings or higher-level abstractions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The set of <code>*-sys</code> packages provides a common set of dependencies for linking
to native libraries. There are a number of benefits earned from having this
convention of native-library-related packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common dependencies on <code>foo-sys</code> alleviates the above rule about one package
per value of <code>links</code>.</li>
<li>A common dependency allows centralizing logic on discovering <code>libfoo</code> itself
(or building it from source).</li>
<li>These dependencies are easily overridable.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#building-libgit2" id="building-libgit2"><h3>Building libgit2</h3></a>
<p>Now that we’ve got libgit2’s dependencies sorted out, we need to actually write
the build script. We’re not going to look at specific snippets of code here and
instead only take a look at the high-level details of the build script of
<code>libgit2-sys</code>. This is not recommending all packages follow this strategy, but
rather just outlining one specific strategy.</p>
<p>The first step of the build script should do is to query whether libgit2 is
already installed on the host system. To do this we’ll leverage the preexisting
tool <code>pkg-config</code> (when its available). We’ll also use a <code>build-dependencies</code>
section to refactor out all the <code>pkg-config</code> related code (or someone’s already
done that!).</p>
<p>If <code>pkg-config</code> failed to find libgit2, or if <code>pkg-config</code> just wasn’t
installed, the next step is to build libgit2 from bundled source code
(distributed as part of <code>libgit2-sys</code> itself). There are a few nuances when
doing so that we need to take into account, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The build system of libgit2, <code>cmake</code>, needs to be able to find libgit2’s
optional dependency of libssh2. We’re sure we’ve already built it (it’s a
Cargo dependency), we just need to communicate this information. To do this
we leverage the metadata format to communicate information between build
scripts. In this example the libssh2 package printed out <code>cargo:root=...</code> to
tell us where libssh2 is installed at, and we can then pass this along to
cmake with the <code>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</code> environment variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ll need to handle some <code>CFLAGS</code> values when compiling C code (and tell
<code>cmake</code> about this). Some flags we may want to pass are <code>-m64</code> for 64-bit
code, <code>-m32</code> for 32-bit code, or <code>-fPIC</code> for 64-bit code as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we’ll invoke <code>cmake</code> to place all output into the <code>OUT_DIR</code>
environment variable, and then we’ll print the necessary metadata to instruct
rustc how to link to libgit2.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the functionality of this build script is easily refactorable into
common dependencies, so our build script isn’t quite as intimidating as this
descriptions! In reality it’s expected that build scripts are quite succinct by
farming logic such as above to build dependencies.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#publishing-on-cratesio" id="publishing-on-cratesio"><h2>Publishing on crates.io</h2></a>
<p>Once you've got a library that you'd like to share with the world, it's time to
publish it on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>! Publishing a crate is when a specific
version is uploaded to be hosted on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>.</p>
<p>Take care when publishing a crate, because a publish is <strong>permanent</strong>. The
version can never be overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted. There is no
limit to the number of versions which can be published, however.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#before-your-first-publish" id="before-your-first-publish"><h3>Before your first publish</h3></a>
<p>First thing’s first, you’ll need an account on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> to acquire
an API token. To do so, <a href="https://crates.io/">visit the home page</a> and log in via a GitHub
account (required for now). After this, visit your <a href="https://crates.io/me">Account
Settings</a> page and run the <code>cargo login</code> command
specified.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo login abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
</code></pre>
<p>This command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally in your
<code>~/.cargo/credentials</code> (previously it was <code>~/.cargo/config</code>).  Note that this
token is a <strong>secret</strong> and should not be shared with anyone else. If it leaks for
any reason, you should regenerate it immediately.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#before-publishing-a-new-crate" id="before-publishing-a-new-crate"><h3>Before publishing a new crate</h3></a>
<p>Keep in mind that crate names on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> are allocated on a first-come-first-
serve basis. Once a crate name is taken, it cannot be used for another crate.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#packaging-a-crate" id="packaging-a-crate"><h4>Packaging a crate</h4></a>
<p>The next step is to package up your crate into a format that can be uploaded to
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>. For this we’ll use the <code>cargo package</code> subcommand. This will take
our entire crate and package it all up into a <code>*.crate</code> file in the
<code>target/package</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo package
</code></pre>
<p>As an added bonus, the <code>*.crate</code> will be verified independently of the current
source tree. After the <code>*.crate</code> is created, it’s unpacked into
<code>target/package</code> and then built from scratch to ensure that all necessary files
are there for the build to succeed. This behavior can be disabled with the
<code>--no-verify</code> flag.</p>
<p>Now’s a good time to take a look at the <code>*.crate</code> file to make sure you didn’t
accidentally package up that 2GB video asset, or large data files used for code
generation, integration tests, or benchmarking.  There is currently a 10MB
upload size limit on <code>*.crate</code> files. So, if the size of <code>tests</code> and <code>benches</code>
directories and their dependencies are up to a couple of MBs, you can keep them
in your package; otherwsie, better to exclude them.</p>
<p>Cargo will automatically ignore files ignored by your version control system
when packaging, but if you want to specify an extra set of files to ignore you
can use the <code>exclude</code> key in the manifest:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
# ...
exclude = [
    &quot;public/assets/*&quot;,
    &quot;videos/*&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax of each element in this array is what
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/glob">rust-lang/glob</a> accepts. If you’d rather
roll with a whitelist instead of a blacklist, Cargo also supports an <code>include</code>
key, which if set, overrides the <code>exclude</code> key:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
# ...
include = [
    &quot;**/*.rs&quot;,
    &quot;Cargo.toml&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#uploading-the-crate" id="uploading-the-crate"><h3>Uploading the crate</h3></a>
<p>Now that we’ve got a <code>*.crate</code> file ready to go, it can be uploaded to
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> with the <code>cargo publish</code> command. And that’s it, you’ve now published

<a class="header" href="print.html#publishing-a-new-version-of-an-existing-crate" id="publishing-a-new-version-of-an-existing-crate"><h3>Publishing a new version of an existing crate</h3></a>
<p>In order to release a new version, change the <code>version</code> value specified in your
<code>Cargo.toml</code> manifest. Keep in mind <a href="reference/manifest.html#the-version-field">the semver
rules</a>. Then optionally run <code>cargo package</code> if
you want to inspect the <code>*.crate</code> file for the new version before publishing,
and run <code>cargo publish</code> to upload the new version.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#managing-a-cratesio-based-crate" id="managing-a-cratesio-based-crate"><h3>Managing a crates.io-based crate</h3></a>
<p>Management of crates is primarily done through the command line <code>cargo</code> tool
rather than the <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> web interface. For this, there are a few subcommands
to manage a crate.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#cargo-yank" id="cargo-yank"><h4><code>cargo yank</code></h4></a>
<p>Occasions may arise where you publish a version of a crate that actually ends up
being broken for one reason or another (syntax error, forgot to include a file,
etc.). For situations such as this, Cargo supports a “yank” of a version of a
crate.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1
$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo
</code></pre>
<p>A yank <strong>does not</strong> delete any code. This feature is not intended for deleting
accidentally uploaded secrets, for example. If that happens, you must reset
those secrets immediately.</p>
<p>The semantics of a yanked version are that no new dependencies can be created
against that version, but all existing dependencies continue to work. One of the
major goals of <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> is to act as a permanent archive of crates that does
not change over time, and allowing deletion of a version would go against this
goal. Essentially a yank means that all projects with a <code>Cargo.lock</code> will not
break, while any future <code>Cargo.lock</code> files generated will not list the yanked
version.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#cargo-owner" id="cargo-owner"><h4><code>cargo owner</code></h4></a>
<p>A crate is often developed by more than one person, or the primary maintainer
may change over time! The owner of a crate is the only person allowed to publish
new versions of the crate, but an owner may designate additional owners.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo owner --add my-buddy
$ cargo owner --remove my-buddy
$ cargo owner --add github:rust-lang:owners
$ cargo owner --remove github:rust-lang:owners
</code></pre>
<p>The owner IDs given to these commands must be GitHub user names or GitHub teams.</p>
<p>If a user name is given to <code>--add</code>, that user becomes a “named” owner, with
full rights to the crate. In addition to being able to publish or yank versions
of the crate, they have the ability to add or remove owners, <em>including</em> the
owner that made <em>them</em> an owner. Needless to say, you shouldn’t make people you
don’t fully trust into a named owner. In order to become a named owner, a user
must have logged into <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> previously.</p>
<p>If a team name is given to <code>--add</code>, that team becomes a “team” owner, with
restricted right to the crate. While they have permission to publish or yank
versions of the crate, they <em>do not</em> have the ability to add or remove owners.
In addition to being more convenient for managing groups of owners, teams are
just a bit more secure against owners becoming malicious.</p>
<p>The syntax for teams is currently <code>github:org:team</code> (see examples above).
In order to add a team as an owner one must be a member of that team. No
such restriction applies to removing a team as an owner.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#github-permissions" id="github-permissions"><h3>GitHub permissions</h3></a>
<p>Team membership is not something GitHub provides simple public access to, and it
is likely for you to encounter the following message when working with them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It looks like you don’t have permission to query a necessary property from
GitHub to complete this request. You may need to re-authenticate on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>
to grant permission to read GitHub org memberships. Just go to
https://crates.io/login</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is basically a catch-all for “you tried to query a team, and one of the
five levels of membership access control denied this”. That is not an
exaggeration. GitHub’s support for team access control is Enterprise Grade.</p>
<p>The most likely cause of this is simply that you last logged in before this
feature was added. We originally requested <em>no</em> permissions from GitHub when
authenticating users, because we didn’t actually ever use the user’s token for
anything other than logging them in. However to query team membership on your
behalf, we now require
<a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes">the <code>read:org</code> scope</a>.</p>
<p>You are free to deny us this scope, and everything that worked before teams
were introduced will keep working. However you will never be able to add a team
as an owner, or publish a crate as a team owner. If you ever attempt to do this,
you will get the error above. You may also see this error if you ever try to
publish a crate that you don’t own at all, but otherwise happens to have a team.</p>
<p>If you ever change your mind, or just aren’t sure if <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> has sufficient
permission, you can always go to https://crates.io/login, which will prompt you
for permission if <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> doesn’t have all the scopes it would like to.</p>
<p>An additional barrier to querying GitHub is that the organization may be
actively denying third party access. To check this, you can go to:</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/organizations/:org/settings/oauth_application_policy
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>:org</code> is the name of the organization (e.g. rust-lang). You may see
something like:</p>
<p><img src="images/org-level-acl.png" alt="Organization Access Control" /></p>
<p>Where you may choose to explicitly remove <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> from your organization’s
blacklist, or simply press the “Remove Restrictions” button to allow all third
party applications to access this data.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> requested the <code>read:org</code> scope, you could have
explicitly whitelisted <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> querying the org in question by pressing
the “Grant Access” button next to its name:</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#package-id-specifications-1" id="package-id-specifications-1"><h3>Package ID specifications</h3></a>
<p>Subcommands of Cargo frequently need to refer to a particular package within a
dependency graph for various operations like updating, cleaning, building, etc.
To solve this problem, Cargo supports Package ID Specifications. A specification
is a string which is used to uniquely refer to one package within a graph of
packages.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#specification-grammar" id="specification-grammar"><h4>Specification grammar</h4></a>
<p>The formal grammar for a Package Id Specification is:</p>

<p>Here, brackets indicate that the contents are optional.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#brevity-of-specifications" id="brevity-of-specifications"><h4>Brevity of specifications</h4></a>
<p>The goal of this is to enable both succinct and exhaustive syntaxes for
referring to packages in a dependency graph. Ambiguous references may refer to
one or more packages. Most commands generate an error if more than one package
could be referred to with the same specification.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#source-replacement" id="source-replacement"><h2>Source Replacement</h2></a>
<p>Cargo supports the ability to <strong>replace one source with another</strong> to express
strategies along the lines of mirrors or vendoring dependencies. Configuration
is currently done through the <a href="reference/config.html"><code>.cargo/config</code> configuration</a> mechanism,
like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># The `source` table is where all keys related to source-replacement
# are stored.
[source]

# Under the `source` table are a number of other tables whose keys are a
# name for the relevant source. For example this section defines a new
# source, called `my-awesome-source`, which comes from a directory
# located at `vendor` relative to the directory containing this `.cargo/config`
# file
[source.my-awesome-source]
directory = &quot;vendor&quot;

# The crates.io default source for crates is available under the name
# &quot;crates-io&quot;, and here we use the `replace-with` key to indicate that it's
# replaced with our source above.
[source.crates-io]
replace-with = &quot;my-awesome-source&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>With this configuration Cargo attempts to look up all crates in the directory
&quot;vendor&quot; rather than querying the online registry at crates.io. Using source
replacement Cargo can express:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vendoring - custom sources can be defined which represent crates on the local
filesystem. These sources are subsets of the source that they're replacing and
can be checked into projects if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mirroring - sources can be replaced with an equivalent version which acts as a
cache for crates.io itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cargo has a core assumption about source replacement that the source code is
exactly the same from both sources. In our above example Cargo assumes that all
of the crates coming from <code>my-awesome-source</code> are the exact same as the copies
from <code>crates-io</code>. Note that this also means that <code>my-awesome-source</code> is not
allowed to have crates which are not present in the <code>crates-io</code> source.</p>
<p>As a consequence, source replacement is not appropriate for situations such as
patching a dependency or a private registry. Cargo supports patching
dependencies through the usage of <a href="reference/manifest.html#the-replace-section">the <code>[replace]</code> key</a>, and
private registry support is planned for a future version of Cargo.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#configuration-1" id="configuration-1"><h3>Configuration</h3></a>
<p>Configuration of replacement sources is done through <a href="reference/config.html"><code>.cargo/config</code></a>
and the full set of available keys are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># Each source has its own table where the key is the name of the source
[source.the-source-name]

# Indicate that `the-source-name` will be replaced with `another-source`,
# defined elsewhere
replace-with = &quot;another-source&quot;

# Available kinds of sources that can be specified (described below)
registry = &quot;https://example.com/path/to/index&quot;
local-registry = &quot;path/to/registry&quot;
directory = &quot;path/to/vendor&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>crates-io</code> represents the crates.io online registry (default source of
crates) and can be replaced with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[source.crates-io]
replace-with = 'another-source'
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#registry-sources" id="registry-sources"><h3>Registry Sources</h3></a>
<p>A &quot;registry source&quot; is one that is the same as crates.io itself. That is, it has
an index served in a git repository which matches the format of the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index">crates.io index</a>. That repository
then has configuration indicating where to download crates from.</p>
<p>Currently there is not an already-available project for setting up a mirror of
crates.io. Stay tuned though!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#local-registry-sources" id="local-registry-sources"><h3>Local Registry Sources</h3></a>
<p>A &quot;local registry source&quot; is intended to be a subset of another registry
source, but available on the local filesystem (aka vendoring). Local registries
are downloaded ahead of time, typically sync'd with a <code>Cargo.lock</code>, and are
made up of a set of <code>*.crate</code> files and an index like the normal registry is.</p>
<p>The primary way to manage and crate local registry sources is through the
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-local-registry"><code>cargo-local-registry</code></a> subcommand, available on
crates.io and can be installed with <code>cargo install cargo-local-registry</code>.</p>
<p>Local registries are contained within one directory and contain a number of
<code>*.crate</code> files downloaded from crates.io as well as an <code>index</code> directory with
the same format as the crates.io-index project (populated with just entries for
the crates that are present).</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#directory-sources" id="directory-sources"><h3>Directory Sources</h3></a>
<p>A &quot;directory source&quot; is similar to a local registry source where it contains a
number of crates available on the local filesystem, suitable for vendoring
dependencies. Also like local registries, directory sources can primarily be
managed by an external subcommand, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-vendor"><code>cargo-vendor</code></a>, which can be
installed with <code>cargo install cargo-vendor</code>.</p>
<p>Directory sources are distinct from local registries though in that they contain
the unpacked version of <code>*.crate</code> files, making it more suitable in some
situations to check everything into source control. A directory source is just a
directory containing a number of other directories which contain the source code
for crates (the unpacked version of <code>*.crate</code> files). Currently no restriction
is placed on the name of each directory.</p>
<p>Each crate in a directory source also has an associated metadata file indicating
the checksum of each file in the crate to protect against accidental
modifications.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#external-tools" id="external-tools"><h2>External tools</h2></a>
<p>One of the goals of Cargo is simple integration with third-party tools, like
IDEs and other build systems. To make integration easier, Cargo has several
facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a <code>cargo metadata</code> command, which outputs project structure and dependencies
information in JSON,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a <code>--message-format</code> flag, which outputs information about a particular build,
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for custom subcommands.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#information-about-project-structure" id="information-about-project-structure"><h3>Information about project structure</h3></a>
<p>You can use <code>cargo metadata</code> command to get information about project structure
and dependencies. The output of the command looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">{
  // Integer version number of the format.
  &quot;version&quot;: integer,

  // List of packages for this workspace, including dependencies.
  &quot;packages&quot;: [
    {
      // Opaque package identifier.
      &quot;id&quot;: PackageId,

      &quot;name&quot;: string,

      &quot;version&quot;: string,

      &quot;source&quot;: SourceId,

      // A list of declared dependencies, see `resolve` field for actual dependencies.
      &quot;dependencies&quot;: [ Dependency ],

      &quot;targets: [ Target ],

      // Path to Cargo.toml
      &quot;manifest_path&quot;: string,
    }
  ],

  &quot;workspace_members&quot;: [ PackageId ],

  // Dependencies graph.
  &quot;resolve&quot;: {
     &quot;nodes&quot;: [
       {
         &quot;id&quot;: PackageId,
         &quot;dependencies&quot;: [ PackageId ]
       }
     ]
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The format is stable and versioned. When calling <code>cargo metadata</code>, you should
pass <code>--format-version</code> flag explicitly to avoid forward incompatibility
hazard.</p>
<p>If you are using Rust, there is <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo_metadata">cargo_metadata</a> crate.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#information-about-build" id="information-about-build"><h3>Information about build</h3></a>
<p>When passing <code>--message-format=json</code>, Cargo will output the following
information during the build:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>compiler errors and warnings,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>produced artifacts,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>results of the build scripts (for example, native dependencies).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The output goes to stdout in the JSON object per line format. The <code>reason</code> field
distinguishes different kinds of messages.</p>
<p>Information about dependencies in the Makefile-compatible format is stored in
the <code>.d</code> files alongside the artifacts.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#custom-subcommands" id="custom-subcommands"><h3>Custom subcommands</h3></a>
<p>Cargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
Cargo itself. This is achieved by translating a cargo invocation of the form
cargo <code>(?&lt;command&gt;[^ ]+)</code> into an invocation of an external tool
<code>cargo-${command}</code> that then needs to be present in one of the user's <code>$PATH</code>
directories.</p>
<p>Custom subcommand may use <code>CARGO</code> environment variable to call back to
Cargo. Alternatively, it can link to <code>cargo</code> crate as a library, but this
approach has drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cargo as a library is unstable, API changes without deprecation,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>versions of Cargo library and Cargo binary may be different.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>No. The plan for Cargo is to use <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, like npm or Rubygems do with
npmjs.org and rubygems.org.</p>
<p>We plan to support git repositories as a source of packages forever,
because they can be used for early development and temporary patches,
even when people use the registry as the primary source of packages.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#why-build-cratesio-rather-than-use-github-as-a-registry" id="why-build-cratesio-rather-than-use-github-as-a-registry"><h3>Why build crates.io rather than use GitHub as a registry?</h3></a>
<p>We think that it’s very important to support multiple ways to download
packages, including downloading from GitHub and copying packages into
your project itself.</p>
<p>That said, we think that <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> offers a number of important benefits, and
will likely become the primary way that people download packages in Cargo.</p>
<p>For precedent, both Node.js’s <a href="https://www.npmjs.org">npm</a> and Ruby’s <a href="https://bundler.io">bundler</a> support both a
central registry model as well as a Git-based model, and most packages
are downloaded through the registry in those ecosystems, with an
important minority of packages making use of git-based packages.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages that make a central registry popular in other
languages include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discoverability</strong>. A central registry provides an easy place to look
for existing packages. Combined with tagging, this also makes it
possible for a registry to provide ecosystem-wide information, such as a
list of the most popular or most-depended-on packages.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>. A central registry makes it possible to easily fetch just
the metadata for packages quickly and efficiently, and then to
efficiently download just the published package, and not other bloat
that happens to exist in the repository. This adds up to a significant
improvement in the speed of dependency resolution and fetching. As
dependency graphs scale up, downloading all of the git repositories bogs
down fast. Also remember that not everybody has a high-speed,
low-latency Internet connection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Cargo handles compiling Rust code, but we know that many Rust projects
link against C code. We also know that there are decades of tooling
built up around compiling languages other than Rust.</p>
<p>Our solution: Cargo allows a package to <a href="reference/build-scripts.html">specify a script</a>
(written in Rust) to run before invoking <code>rustc</code>. Rust is leveraged to
implement platform-specific configuration and refactor out common build
functionality among packages.</p>

<p>Indeed. While we intend Cargo to be useful as a standalone way to
compile Rust projects at the top-level, we know that some people will
want to invoke Cargo from other build tools.</p>
<p>We have designed Cargo to work well in those contexts, paying attention
to things like error codes and machine-readable output modes. We still
have some work to do on those fronts, but using Cargo in the context of
conventional scripts is something we designed for from the beginning and
will continue to prioritize.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#why-do-binaries-have-cargolock-in-version-control-but-not-libraries" id="why-do-binaries-have-cargolock-in-version-control-but-not-libraries"><h3>Why do binaries have <code>Cargo.lock</code> in version control, but not libraries?</h3></a>
<p>The purpose of a <code>Cargo.lock</code> is to describe the state of the world at the time
of a successful build. It is then used to provide deterministic builds across
whatever machine is building the project by ensuring that the exact same
dependencies are being compiled.</p>
<p>This property is most desirable from applications and projects which are at the
very end of the dependency chain (binaries). As a result, it is recommended that
all binaries check in their <code>Cargo.lock</code>.</p>
<p>For libraries the situation is somewhat different. A library is not only used by
the library developers, but also any downstream consumers of the library. Users
dependent on the library will not inspect the library’s <code>Cargo.lock</code> (even if it
exists). This is precisely because a library should <strong>not</strong> be deterministically
recompiled for all users of the library.</p>
<p>If a library ends up being used transitively by several dependencies, it’s
likely that just a single copy of the library is desired (based on semver
compatibility). If all libraries were to check in their <code>Cargo.lock</code>, then
multiple copies of the library would be used, and perhaps even a version
conflict.</p>
<p>In other words, libraries specify semver requirements for their dependencies but
cannot see the full picture. Only end products like binaries have a full
picture to decide what versions of dependencies should be used.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#can-libraries-use--as-a-version-for-their-dependencies" id="can-libraries-use--as-a-version-for-their-dependencies"><h3>Can libraries use <code>*</code> as a version for their dependencies?</h3></a>
<p><strong>As of January 22nd, 2016, <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> rejects all packages (not just libraries)
with wildcard dependency constraints.</strong></p>
<p>While libraries <em>can</em>, strictly speaking, they should not. A version requirement
of <code>*</code> says “This will work with every version ever,” which is never going
to be true. Libraries should always specify the range that they do work with,
even if it’s something as general as “every 1.x.y version.”</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#why-cargotoml" id="why-cargotoml"><h3>Why <code>Cargo.toml</code>?</h3></a>
<p>As one of the most frequent interactions with Cargo, the question of why the
configuration file is named <code>Cargo.toml</code> arises from time to time. The leading
capital-<code>C</code> was chosen to ensure that the manifest was grouped with other
similar configuration files in directory listings. Sorting files often puts
capital letters before lowercase letters, ensuring files like <code>Makefile</code> and
<code>Cargo.toml</code> are placed together. The trailing <code>.toml</code> was chosen to emphasize
the fact that the file is in the <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML configuration
format</a>.</p>
<p>Cargo does not allow other names such as <code>cargo.toml</code> or <code>Cargofile</code> to
emphasize the ease of how a Cargo repository can be identified. An option of
many possible names has historically led to confusion where one case was handled
but others were accidentally forgotten.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#how-can-cargo-work-offline" id="how-can-cargo-work-offline"><h3>How can Cargo work offline?</h3></a>
<p>Cargo is often used in situations with limited or no network access such as
airplanes, CI environments, or embedded in large production deployments. Users
are often surprised when Cargo attempts to fetch resources from the network, and
hence the request for Cargo to work offline comes up frequently.</p>
<p>Cargo, at its heart, will not attempt to access the network unless told to do
so. That is, if no crates comes from crates.io, a git repository, or some other
network location, Cargo will never attempt to make a network connection. As a
result, if Cargo attempts to touch the network, then it's because it needs to
fetch a required resource.</p>
<p>Cargo is also quite aggressive about caching information to minimize the amount
of network activity. It will guarantee, for example, that if <code>cargo build</code> (or
an equivalent) is run to completion then the next <code>cargo build</code> is guaranteed to
not touch the network so long as <code>Cargo.toml</code> has not been modified in the
meantime. This avoidance of the network boils down to a <code>Cargo.lock</code> existing
and a populated cache of the crates reflected in the lock file. If either of
these components are missing, then they're required for the build to succeed and
must be fetched remotely.</p>
<p>As of Rust 1.11.0 Cargo understands a new flag, <code>--frozen</code>, which is an
assertion that it shouldn't touch the network. When passed, Cargo will
immediately return an error if it would otherwise attempt a network request.
The error should include contextual information about why the network request is
being made in the first place to help debug as well. Note that this flag <em>does
not change the behavior of Cargo</em>, it simply asserts that Cargo shouldn't touch
the network as a previous command has been run to ensure that network activity
shouldn't be necessary.</p>
