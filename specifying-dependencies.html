    <h1 class="title">Specifying Dependencies</h1>
    <p>Your crates can depend on other libraries from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, <code>git</code> repositories, or
subdirectories on your local file system. You can also temporarily override the
location of a dependency— for example, to be able to test out a bug fix in the
dependency that you are working on locally. You can have different
dependencies for different platforms, and dependencies that are only used during
development. Let&#39;s take a look at how to do each of these.</p>

<h1 id='specifying-dependencies-from-cratesio' class='section-header'><a href='#specifying-dependencies-from-cratesio'>Specifying dependencies from crates.io</a></h1>
<p>Cargo is configured to look for dependencies on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> by default. Only
the name and a version string are required in this case. In <a href="guide.html">the cargo
guide</a>, we specified a dependency on the <code>time</code> crate:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
time = &quot;0.1.12&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The string <code>&quot;0.1.12&quot;</code> is a <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik/semver#requirements">semver</a> version requirement. Since this
string does not have any operators in it, it is interpreted the same way as
if we had specified <code>&quot;^0.1.12&quot;</code>, which is called a caret requirement.</p>

<h2 id='caret-requirements' class='section-header'><a href='#caret-requirements'>Caret requirements</a></h2>
<p><strong>Caret requirements</strong> allow SemVer compatible updates to a specified version.
An update is allowed if the new version number does not modify the left-most
non-zero digit in the major, minor, patch grouping. In this case, if we ran
<code>cargo update -p time</code>, cargo would update us to version <code>0.1.13</code> if it was
available, but would not update us to <code>0.2.0</code>. If instead we had specified the
version string as <code>^1.0</code>, cargo would update to <code>1.1</code> but not <code>2.0</code>. <code>0.0.x</code> is
not considered compatible with any other version.</p>

<p>Here are some more examples of caret requirements and the versions that would
be allowed with them:</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">^1.2.3 := &gt;=1.2.3 &lt;2.0.0
^1.2 := &gt;=1.2.0 &lt;2.0.0
^1 := &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0
^0.2.3 := &gt;=0.2.3 &lt;0.3.0
^0.0.3 := &gt;=0.0.3 &lt;0.0.4
^0.0 := &gt;=0.0.0 &lt;0.1.0
^0 := &gt;=0.0.0 &lt;1.0.0
</code></pre>

<p>This compatibility convention is different from SemVer in the way it treats
versions before 1.0.0. While SemVer says there is no compatibility before
1.0.0, Cargo considers <code>0.x.y</code> to be compatible with <code>0.x.z</code>, where <code>y ≥ z</code>
and <code>x &gt; 0</code>.</p>

<h2 id='tilde-requirements' class='section-header'><a href='#tilde-requirements'>Tilde requirements</a></h2>
<p><strong>Tilde requirements</strong> specify a minimal version with some ability to update.
If you specify a major, minor, and patch version or only a major and minor
version, only patch-level changes are allowed. If you only specify a major
version, then minor- and patch-level changes are allowed.</p>

<p><code>~1.2.3</code> is an example of a tilde requirement.</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">~1.2.3 := &gt;=1.2.3 &lt;1.3.0
~1.2 := &gt;=1.2.0 &lt;1.3.0
~1 := &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0
</code></pre>

<h2 id='wildcard-requirements' class='section-header'><a href='#wildcard-requirements'>Wildcard requirements</a></h2>
<p><strong>Wildcard requirements</strong> allow for any version where the wildcard is
positioned.</p>

<p><code>*</code>, <code>1.*</code> and <code>1.2.*</code> are examples of wildcard requirements.</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">* := &gt;=0.0.0
1.* := &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0
1.2.* := &gt;=1.2.0 &lt;1.3.0
</code></pre>

<h2 id='inequality-requirements' class='section-header'><a href='#inequality-requirements'>Inequality requirements</a></h2>
<p><strong>Inequality requirements</strong> allow manually specifying a version range or an
exact version to depend on.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of inequality requirements:</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">&gt;= 1.2.0
&gt; 1
&lt; 2
= 1.2.3
</code></pre>

<h2 id='multiple-requirements' class='section-header'><a href='#multiple-requirements'>Multiple requirements</a></h2>
<p>Multiple version requirements can also be separated with a comma, e.g. <code>&gt;= 1.2, &lt; 1.5</code>.</p>

<h1 id='specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories' class='section-header'><a href='#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories'>Specifying dependencies from <code>git</code> repositories</a></h1>
<p>To depend on a library located in a <code>git</code> repository, the minimum information
you need to specify is the location of the repository with the <code>git</code> key:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = { git = &quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand&quot; }
</code></pre>

<p>Cargo will fetch the <code>git</code> repository at this location then look for a
<code>Cargo.toml</code> for the requested crate anywhere inside the <code>git</code> repository
(not necessarily at the root).</p>

<p>Since we haven’t specified any other information, Cargo assumes that
we intend to use the latest commit on the <code>master</code> branch to build our project.
You can combine the <code>git</code> key with the <code>rev</code>, <code>tag</code>, or <code>branch</code> keys to
specify something else. Here&#39;s an example of specifying that you want to use
the latest commit on a branch named <code>next</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = { git = &quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand&quot;, branch = &quot;next&quot; }
</code></pre>

<h1 id='specifying-path-dependencies' class='section-header'><a href='#specifying-path-dependencies'>Specifying path dependencies</a></h1>
<p>Over time, our <code>hello_world</code> project from <a href="guide.html">the guide</a> has grown
significantly in size! It’s gotten to the point that we probably want to
split out a separate crate for others to use. To do this Cargo supports
<strong>path dependencies</strong> which are typically sub-crates that live within one
repository. Let’s start off by making a new crate inside of our <code>hello_world</code>
project:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell"># inside of hello_world/
$ cargo new hello_utils
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new folder <code>hello_utils</code> inside of which a <code>Cargo.toml</code> and
<code>src</code> folder are ready to be configured. In order to tell Cargo about this, open
up <code>hello_world/Cargo.toml</code> and add <code>hello_utils</code> to your dependencies:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
hello_utils = { path = &quot;hello_utils&quot; }
</code></pre>

<p>This tells Cargo that we depend on a crate called <code>hello_utils</code> which is found
in the <code>hello_utils</code> folder (relative to the <code>Cargo.toml</code> it’s written in).</p>

<p>And that’s it! The next <code>cargo build</code> will automatically build <code>hello_utils</code> and
all of its own dependencies, and others can also start using the crate as well.
However, crates that use dependencies specified with only a path are not
permitted on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>. If we wanted to publish our <code>hello_world</code> crate, we
would need to publish a version of <code>hello_utils</code> to <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>
and specify its version in the dependencies line as well:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
hello_utils = { path = &quot;hello_utils&quot;, version = &quot;0.1.0&quot; }
</code></pre>

<h1 id='overriding-dependencies' class='section-header'><a href='#overriding-dependencies'>Overriding dependencies</a></h1>
<p>There are a number of methods in Cargo to support overriding dependencies and
otherwise controlling the dependency graph. These options are typically, though,
only available at the workspace level and aren&#39;t propagated through
dependencies. In other words, &quot;applications&quot; have the ability to override
dependencies but &quot;libraries&quot; do not.</p>

<p>The desire to override a dependency or otherwise alter some dependencies can
arise through a number of scenarios. Most of them, however, boil down to the
ability to work with a crate before it&#39;s been published to crates.io. For
example:</p>

<ul>
<li>A crate you&#39;re working on is also used in a much larger application you&#39;re
working on, and you&#39;d like to test a bug fix to the library inside of the
larger application.</li>
<li>An upstream crate you don&#39;t work on has a new feature or a bug fix on the
master branch of its git repository which you&#39;d like to test out.</li>
<li>You&#39;re about to publish a new major version of your crate, but you&#39;d like to
do integration testing across an entire project to ensure the new major
version works.</li>
<li>You&#39;ve submitted a fix to an upstream crate for a bug you found, but you&#39;d
like to immediately have your application start depending on the fixed version
of the crate to avoid blocking on the bug fix getting merged.</li>
</ul>

<p>These scenarios are currently all solved with the <a href="manifest.html#the-patch-section"><code>[patch]</code> manifest
section</a>. (Note that the <code>[patch]</code> feature will first become
available in Rust 1.21, set to be released on 2017-10-12.) Historically some of
these scenarios have been solved with <a href="manifest.html#the-replace-section">the <code>[replace]</code> section</a>,
but we&#39;ll document the <code>[patch]</code> section here.</p>

<h3 id='testing-a-bugfix' class='section-header'><a href='#testing-a-bugfix'>Testing a bugfix</a></h3>
<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re working with the [<code>uuid</code>] crate but while you&#39;re working on it
you discover a bug. You are, however, quite enterprising so you decide to also
try out to fix the bug! Originally your manifest will look like:</p>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/uuid"><code>uuid</code></a></p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;my-library&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;...&quot;]

[dependencies]
uuid = &quot;1.0&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>First thing we&#39;ll do is to clone the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid"><code>uuid</code> repository</a>
locally via:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid
</code></pre>

<p>Next we&#39;ll edit the manifest of <code>my-library</code> to contain:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { path = &quot;../path/to/uuid&quot; }
</code></pre>

<p>Here we declare that we&#39;re <em>patching</em> the source <code>crates-io</code> with a new
dependency. This will effectively add the local checked out version of <code>uuid</code> to
the crates.io registry for our local project.</p>

<p>Next up we need to ensure that our lock file is updated to use this new version
of <code>uuid</code> so our project uses the locally checked out copy instead of one from
crates.io. The way <code>[patch]</code> works is that it&#39;ll load the dependency at
<code>../path/to/uuid</code> and then whenever crates.io is queried for versions of <code>uuid</code>
it&#39;ll <em>also</em> return the local version.</p>

<p>This means that the version number of the local checkout is significant and will
affect whether the patch is used. Our manifest declared <code>uuid = &quot;1.0&quot;</code> which
means we&#39;ll only resolve to <code>&gt;= 1.0.0, &lt; 2.0.0</code>, and Cargo&#39;s greedy resolution
algorithm also means that we&#39;ll resolve to the maximum version within that
range. Typically this doesn&#39;t matter as the version of the git repository will
already be greater or match the maximum version published on crates.io, but it&#39;s
important to keep this in mind!</p>

<p>In any case, typically all you need to do now is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo build
   Compiling uuid v1.0.0 (file://.../uuid)
   Compiling my-library v0.1.0 (file://.../my-library)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs
</code></pre>

<p>And that&#39;s it! You&#39;re now building with the local version of <code>uuid</code> (note the
<code>file://</code> in the build output). If you don&#39;t see the <code>file://</code> version getting
built then you may need to run <code>cargo update -p uuid --precise $version</code> where
<code>$version</code> is the version of the locally checked out copy of <code>uuid</code>.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve fixed the bug you originally found the next thing you&#39;ll want to do
is to likely submit that as a pull request to the <code>uuid</code> crate itself. Once
you&#39;ve done this then you can also update the <code>[patch]</code> section. The listing
inside of <code>[patch]</code> is just like the <code>[dependencies]</code> section, so once your pull
request is merged you could change your <code>path</code> dependency to:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { git = &#39;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid&#39; }
</code></pre>

<h3 id='working-with-an-unpublished-minor-version' class='section-header'><a href='#working-with-an-unpublished-minor-version'>Working with an unpublished minor version</a></h3>
<p>Let&#39;s now shift gears a bit from bug fixes to adding features. While working on
<code>my-library</code> you discover that a whole new feature is needed in the <code>uuid</code>
crate. You&#39;ve implemented this feature, tested it locally above with <code>[patch]</code>,
and submitted a pull request. Let&#39;s go over how you continue to use and test it
before it&#39;s actually published.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s also say that the current version of <code>uuid</code> on crates.io is <code>1.0.0</code>, but
since then the master branch of the git repository has updated to <code>1.0.1</code>. This
branch includes your new feature you submitted previously. To use this
repository we&#39;ll edit our <code>Cargo.toml</code> to look like</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;my-library&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;...&quot;]

[dependencies]
uuid = &quot;1.0.1&quot;

[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { git = &#39;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid&#39; }
</code></pre>

<p>Note that our local dependency on <code>uuid</code> has been updated to <code>1.0.1</code> as it&#39;s
what we&#39;ll actually require once the crate is published. This version doesn&#39;t
exist on crates.io, though, so we provide it with the <code>[patch]</code> section of the
manifest.</p>

<p>Now when our library is built it&#39;ll fetch <code>uuid</code> from the git repository and
resolve to 1.0.1 inside the repository instead of trying to download a version
from crates.io. Once 1.0.1 is published on crates.io the <code>[patch]</code> section can
be deleted.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth nothing that <code>[patch]</code> applies <em>transitively</em>. Let&#39;s say you use
<code>my-library</code> in a larger project, such as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;my-binary&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;...&quot;]

[dependencies]
my-library = { git = &#39;https://example.com/git/my-library&#39; }
uuid = &quot;1.0&quot;

[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { git = &#39;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid&#39; }
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that <code>[patch]</code> is only applicable at the <em>top level</em> so we consumers of
<code>my-library</code> have to repeat the <code>[patch]</code> section if necessary. Here, though,
the new <code>uuid</code> crate applies to <em>both</em> our dependency on <code>uuid</code> and the
<code>my-library -&gt; uuid</code> dependency. The <code>uuid</code> crate will be resolved to one
version for this entire crate graph, 1.0.1, and it&#39;ll be pulled from the git
repository.</p>

<h3 id='prepublishing-a-breaking-change' class='section-header'><a href='#prepublishing-a-breaking-change'>Prepublishing a breaking change</a></h3>
<p>As a final scenario, let&#39;s take a look at working with a new major version of a
crate, typically accompanied with breaking changes. Sticking with our previous
crates, this means that we&#39;re going to be creating version 2.0.0 of the <code>uuid</code>
crate. After we&#39;ve submitted all changes upstream we can update our manifest for
<code>my-library</code> to look like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
uuid = &quot;2.0&quot;

[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { git = &quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid&quot;, branch = &quot;2.0.0&quot; }
</code></pre>

<p>And that&#39;s it! Like with the previous example the 2.0.0 version doesn&#39;t actually
exist on crates.io but we can still put it in through a git dependency through
the usage of the <code>[patch]</code> section. As a thought exercise let&#39;s take another
look at the <code>my-binary</code> manifest from above again as well:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;my-binary&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;...&quot;]

[dependencies]
my-library = { git = &#39;https://example.com/git/my-library&#39; }
uuid = &quot;1.0&quot;

[patch.crates-io]
uuid = { git = &#39;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid&#39;, version = &#39;2.0.0&#39; }
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this will actually resolve to two versions of the <code>uuid</code> crate. The
<code>my-binary</code> crate will continue to use the 1.x.y series of the <code>uuid</code> crate but
the <code>my-library</code> crate will use the 2.0.0 version of <code>uuid</code>. This will allow you
to gradually roll out breaking changes to a crate through a dependency graph
without being force to update everything all at once.</p>

<h3 id='overriding-with-local-dependencies' class='section-header'><a href='#overriding-with-local-dependencies'>Overriding with local dependencies</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you&#39;re only temporarily working on a crate and you don&#39;t want to have
to modify <code>Cargo.toml</code> like with the <code>[patch]</code> section above. For this use
case Cargo offers a much more limited version of overrides called <strong>path
overrides</strong>.</p>

<p>Path overrides are specified through <code>.cargo/config</code> instead of <code>Cargo.toml</code>,
and you can find <a href="config.html">more documentation about this configuration</a>.
Inside of <code>.cargo/config</code> you&#39;ll specify a key called <code>paths</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">paths = [&quot;/path/to/uuid&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>This array should be filled with directories that contain a <code>Cargo.toml</code>. In
this instance, we’re just adding <code>uuid</code>, so it will be the only one that’s
overridden. This path can be either absolute or relative to the directory that
contains the <code>.cargo</code> folder.</p>

<p>Path overrides are more restricted than the <code>[patch]</code> section, however, in
that they cannot change the structure of the dependency graph. When a
path replacement is used then the previous set of dependencies
must all match exactly to the new <code>Cargo.toml</code> specification. For example this
means that path overrides cannot be used to test out adding a dependency to a
crate, instead <code>[patch]</code> must be used in that situation. As a result usage of a
path override is typically isolated to quick bug fixes rather than larger
changes.</p>

<p>Note: using a local configuration to override paths will only work for crates
that have been published to <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>. You cannot use this feature to tell
Cargo how to find local unpublished crates.</p>

<h1 id='platform-specific-dependencies' class='section-header'><a href='#platform-specific-dependencies'>Platform specific dependencies</a></h1>
<p>Platform-specific dependencies take the same format, but are listed under a
<code>target</code> section. Normally Rust-like <code>#[cfg]</code> syntax will be used to define
these sections:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.&#39;cfg(windows)&#39;.dependencies]
winhttp = &quot;0.4.0&quot;

[target.&#39;cfg(unix)&#39;.dependencies]
openssl = &quot;1.0.1&quot;

[target.&#39;cfg(target_arch = &quot;x86&quot;)&#39;.dependencies]
native = { path = &quot;native/i686&quot; }

[target.&#39;cfg(target_arch = &quot;x86_64&quot;)&#39;.dependencies]
native = { path = &quot;native/x86_64&quot; }
</code></pre>

<p>Like with Rust, the syntax here supports the <code>not</code>, <code>any</code>, and <code>all</code> operators
to combine various cfg name/value pairs. Note that the <code>cfg</code> syntax has only
been available since Cargo 0.9.0 (Rust 1.8.0).</p>

<p>In addition to <code>#[cfg]</code> syntax, Cargo also supports listing out the full target
the dependencies would apply to:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.dependencies]
winhttp = &quot;0.4.0&quot;

[target.i686-unknown-linux-gnu.dependencies]
openssl = &quot;1.0.1&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>If you’re using a custom target specification, quote the full path and file
name:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.&quot;x86_64/windows.json&quot;.dependencies]
winhttp = &quot;0.4.0&quot;

[target.&quot;i686/linux.json&quot;.dependencies]
openssl = &quot;1.0.1&quot;
native = { path = &quot;native/i686&quot; }

[target.&quot;x86_64/linux.json&quot;.dependencies]
openssl = &quot;1.0.1&quot;
native = { path = &quot;native/x86_64&quot; }
</code></pre>

<h1 id='development-dependencies' class='section-header'><a href='#development-dependencies'>Development dependencies</a></h1>
<p>You can add a <code>[dev-dependencies]</code> section to your <code>Cargo.toml</code> whose format
is equivalent to <code>[dependencies]</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dev-dependencies]
tempdir = &quot;0.3&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Dev-dependencies are not used when compiling
a package for building, but are used for compiling tests, examples, and
benchmarks.</p>

<p>These dependencies are <em>not</em> propagated to other packages which depend on this
package.</p>

<p>You can also have target-specific development dependencies by using
<code>dev-dependencies</code> in the target section header instead of <code>dependencies</code>. For
example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.&#39;cfg(unix)&#39;.dev-dependencies]
mio = &quot;0.0.1&quot;
</code></pre>

<h1 id='build-dependencies' class='section-header'><a href='#build-dependencies'>Build dependencies</a></h1>
<p>You can depend on other Cargo-based crates for use in your build scripts.
Dependencies are declared through the <code>build-dependencies</code> section of the
manifest:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[build-dependencies]
gcc = &quot;0.3&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The build script <strong>does not</strong> have access to the dependencies listed
in the <code>dependencies</code> or <code>dev-dependencies</code> section. Build
dependencies will likewise not be available to the package itself
unless listed under the <code>dependencies</code> section as well. A package
itself and its build script are built separately, so their
dependencies need not coincide. Cargo is kept simpler and cleaner by
using independent dependencies for independent purposes.</p>

<h1 id='choosing-features' class='section-header'><a href='#choosing-features'>Choosing features</a></h1>
<p>If a package you depend on offers conditional features, you can
specify which to use:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies.awesome]
version = &quot;1.3.5&quot;
default-features = false # do not include the default features, and optionally
                         # cherry-pick individual features
features = [&quot;secure-password&quot;, &quot;civet&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>More information about features can be found in the
<a href="manifest.html#the-features-section">manifest documentation</a>.</p>
